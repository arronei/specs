Abstract: This specification defines the 5th major version, first minor revision of the core
          language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version,
          new features continue to be introduced to help Web application authors, new elements
          continue to be introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and
          special attention continues to be given to defining clear conformance criteria for user
          agents in an effort to improve interoperability.

<h3 id="text-html"><dfn><code>text/html</code></dfn></h3>

  This registration is for community review and will be submitted to the IESG for review, approval,
  and registration with IANA.

  : Type name:
  :: text

  : Subtype name:
  :: html

  : Required parameters:
  :: No required parameters

  : Optional parameters:
  ::
      : <code>charset</code>
      :: The <code>charset</code> parameter may be provided to specify the <a>document's character
          encoding</a>, overriding any <a>character encoding declarations</a> in the document other
          than a Byte Order Mark (BOM). The parameter's value must be one of the <a>labels</a> of
          the <a>character encoding</a> used to serialize the file. [[!ENCODING]]

  : Encoding considerations:
  :: 8bit (see the section on <a>character encoding declarations</a>)

  : Security considerations:
  :: Entire novels have been written about the security considerations that apply to HTML documents.
      Many are listed in this document, to which the reader is referred for more details. Some
      general concerns bear mentioning here, however:

      HTML is scripted language, and has a large number of APIs (some of which are described in
      this document). Script can expose the user to potential risks of information leakage,
      credential leakage, cross-site scripting attacks, cross-site request forgeries, and a host of
      other problems. While the designs in this specification are intended to be safe if implemented
      correctly, a full implementation is a massive undertaking and, as with any software, user
      agents are likely to have security bugs.

      Even without scripting, there are specific features in HTML which, for historical reasons,
      are required for broad compatibility with legacy content but that expose the user to
      unfortunate security problems. In particular, the <code>img</code> element can be used in
      conjunction with some other features as a way to effect a port scan from the user's location
      on the Internet. This can expose local network topologies that the attacker would otherwise
      not be able to determine.

      HTML relies on a compartmentalization scheme sometimes known as the <i>same-origin policy</i>.
      An <a>origin</a> in most cases consists of all the pages served from the same host, on the
      same port, using the same protocol.

      It is critical, therefore, to ensure that any untrusted content that forms part of a site be
      hosted on a different <a>origin</a> than any sensitive content on that site. Untrusted
      content can easily spoof any other page on the same origin, read data from that origin, cause
      scripts in that origin to execute, submit forms to and from that origin even if they are
      protected from cross-site request forgery attacks by unique tokens, and make use of any
      third-party resources exposed to or rights granted to that origin.

  : Interoperability considerations:
  :: Rules for processing both conforming and non-conforming content are defined in this
      specification.

  : Published specification:
  :: This document is the relevant specification. Labeling a resource with the
      <code>text/html</code> type asserts that the resource is an <a>HTML document</a> using
      <a>the HTML syntax</a>.

  : Applications that use this media type:
  :: Web browsers, tools for processing Web content, HTML authoring tools, search engines,
      validators.

  : Additional information:
  ::
      : Magic number(s):
      :: No sequence of bytes can uniquely identify an HTML document. More information on detecting
          HTML documents is available in the MIME Sniffing specification. [[!MIMESNIFF]]

      : File extension(s):
      :: "<code>html</code>" and "<code>htm</code>" are commonly, but certainly not exclusively,
          used as the extension for HTML documents.

<h3 id="application-x-www-form-urlencoded"><dfn><code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code></dfn></h3>

  This registration is for community review and will be submitted to the IESG for review, approval,

  : Optional parameters:
  :: No parameters

  : Encoding considerations:
  :: 7bit (US-ASCII encoding of octets that themselves can be encoding text using any
      <a>ASCII-compatible encoding</a>)

  : Security considerations:
  :: In isolation, an <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> payload poses no security
      risks. However, as this type is usually used as part of a form submission, all the risks that
      apply to HTML forms need to be considered in the context of this type.

  : Interoperability considerations:
  :: Rules for generating and processing <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code> payloads are
      defined in this specification.

  : Published specification:
  :: This document is the relevant specification. Algorithms for <a>encoding</a> and <a>decoding</a>
      are defined.

  : Applications that use this media type:

<h3 id="text-cache-manifest"><dfn><code>text/cache-manifest</code></dfn></h3>

  This registration is for community review and will be submitted to the IESG for review, approval,
  and registration with IANA.

  : Type name:
  :: text

  : Subtype name:
  :: cache-manifest

  : Required parameters:
  :: No parameters

  : Optional parameters:
  ::
      : <code>charset</code>
      :: The <code>charset</code> parameter may be provided. The parameter's value must be
          "<code>utf-8</code>". This parameter serves no purpose; it is only allowed for
          compatibility with legacy servers.

  : Encoding considerations:
  :: 8bit (always UTF-8)

  : Security considerations:
  :: Cache manifests themselves pose no immediate risk unless sensitive information is included
      within the manifest. Implementations, however, are required to follow specific rules when
      populating a cache based on a cache manifest, to ensure that certain origin-based restrictions
      are honored. Failure to correctly implement these rules can result in information leakage,
      cross-site scripting attacks, and the like.

  : Interoperability considerations:
  :: Rules for processing both conforming and non-conforming content are defined in this
      specification.

  : Published specification:
  :: This document is the relevant specification.

  : Applications that use this media type:
  :: Web browsers.

  : Additional information:
  ::
      : Magic number(s):
      :: Cache manifests begin with the string "<code>CACHE MANIFEST</code>", followed by either a
          U+0020 SPACE character, a U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION (tab) character, a U+000A LINE FEED
          (LF) character, or a U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) character.

<h3 id="web-scheme-prefix"><dfn><code>web+</code> scheme prefix</dfn></h3>

  This section describes a convention for use with the IANA URI scheme registry. It does not
  itself register a specific scheme. [[!RFC4395]]

  : URI scheme name:
  :: Schemes starting with the four characters "<code>web+</code>" followed by one or more letters
      in the range <code>a</code>-<code>z</code>.

  : Status:
  :: permanent

  : URI scheme syntax:
  :: Scheme-specific.

  : URI scheme semantics:
  :: Scheme-specific.

  : Encoding considerations:
  :: All "<code>web+</code>" schemes should use UTF-8 encodings where relevant.

  : Applications/protocols that use this URI scheme name:
  :: Scheme-specific.

  : Interoperability considerations:
  :: The scheme is expected to be used in the context of Web applications.

  : Security considerations:
  :: Any Web page is able to register a handler for all "<code>web+</code>" schemes. As
      such, these schemes must not be used for features intended to be core platform features (e.g.
      network transfer protocols like HTTP or FTP). Similarly, such schemes must not store
      confidential information in their URLs, such as usernames, passwords, personal information, or
      confidential project names.
