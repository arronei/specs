Abstract: This specification defines the 5th major version, first minor revision of the core
          language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version,
          new features continue to be introduced to help Web application authors, new elements
          continue to be introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and
          special attention continues to be given to defining clear conformance criteria for user
          agents in an effort to improve interoperability.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML. HTML was primarily designed as a
    language for semantically describing scientific documents, although its general design and
    adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of
    documents.

    The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a vague subject referred to as
    Web Applications. This standard attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the
    HTML language to address issues raised in the past few years.

<h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features
    defined in this specification<span class="impl">, implementors of tools that operate on pages
    that use the features defined in this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the
    correctness of documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of this
    specification</span>.

    This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing
    familiarity with Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity
    for completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler
    introduction to the topic.

    In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of
    some of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML,
    Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not
    essential.

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated
    semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static
    documents to dynamic applications.

    The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for media-specific
    customization of presentation (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at
    the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as part
    of the language).

    The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular,
    hardware configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
    expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of
    applications, this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected
    to be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low
    CPU requirements. Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching
    systems, games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books,
    communications software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software),
    document editing software, etc.

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a
    number of extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.

    With the creation of the W3C, HTML's development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt
    at extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as
    HTML 3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML4 quickly followed later that same year.

    The following year, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on
    an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML,
    known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was
    completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0, the W3C's focus turned to making it easier for other working
    groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C
    also worked on a new language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages,
    calling it XHTML2.

    Around the time that HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed
    by browser vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM
    Level 2 Core and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then
    petered out, with some DOM Level 3 specifications published in 2004 but the working group being
    closed before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.

    In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of
    Web forms, sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements
    for it. This interest was borne from the realization that XML's deployment as a Web technology
    was limited to entirely new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement
    for existing deployed technologies (like HTML).

    A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML4's forms to provide many of the
    features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines
    that were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of this renewed
    interest. At this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was
    already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software's
    copyright.

    The idea that HTML's evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where
    some of the principles that underlie the HTML5 work (described below), as well as the
    aforementioned early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the
    W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal
    conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web's evolution; the W3C staff and
    membership voted to continue developing XML-based replacements instead.

    Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue
    working on the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list
    was created, and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended
    to be jointly owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specification.

    The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be
    backwards compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means
    changing the specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be
    detailed enough that implementations can achieve complete interoperability without
    reverse-engineering each other.

    The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML5 specification include
    what had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2 HTML. It
    also meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered the norm.

    In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5 after all,
    and in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the
    HTML5 specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification
    under the W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG
    site.

    For a number of years, both groups then worked together under the same editor: Ian Hickson.
    In 2011, the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to
    draw a line in the sand for features for a HTML5 Recommendation, while the WHATWG wanted to
    continue working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification
    and adding new features. In mid 2012, a new editing team was introduced at the W3C to take
    care of creating a HTML5 Recommendation and prepare a Working Draft for the next HTML
    version.

    Since then, the W3C HTML WG has been cherry picking patches from the WHATWG that resolved bugs
    registered on the W3C HTML specification or more accurately represented implemented reality in
    UAs. At time of publication of this document, patches from the <a>WHATWG HTML specification</a>
    have been merged until revision <a>8424</a> inclusive. The W3C HTML editors have also added
    patches that resulted from discussions and decisions made by the W3C HTML WG as well a bug
    fixes from bugs not shared by the WHATWG.

    A separate document is published to document the differences between the HTML specified
    in this document and the language described in the HTML4 specification. [[HTML5-DIFF]]

<h3 id="design-notes">Design notes</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and
    inconsistent.

    HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have been
    developed over a period of several decades by a wide array of people with different priorities
    who, in many cases, did not know of each other's existence.

    Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always been designed in especially
    consistent ways. Furthermore, because of the unique characteristics of the Web, implementation
    bugs have often become de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is often unintentionally
    written in ways that rely on them before they can be fixed.

    Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain design goals. These are described
    in the next few subsections.

<h4 id="serializability-of-script-execution">Serializability of script execution</h4>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are
    designed such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even
    with <a>workers</a>, the intent is that the behavior of implementations
    can be thought of as completely serializing the execution of all scripts in all
    <span data-x="browsing context">browsing contexts</span>.

    The
    {{navigator}}.<<yieldForStorageUpdates()>>
    method, in this model, is equivalent to allowing other scripts to run while the calling script
    is blocked.

<h4 id="compliance-with-other-specifications">Compliance with other specifications</h4>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of other specifications. In
    certain circumstances, unfortunately, conflicting needs have led to this specification violating
    the requirements of these other specifications. Whenever this has occurred, the transgressions
    have each been noted as a "<dfn>willful violation</dfn>", and the reason for the violation has
    been noted.

<h4 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h4>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    HTML has a wide array of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a
    safe manner:

    * Authors can use the <code>class</code> attribute to extend elements,
        effectively creating their own elements, while using the most applicable existing "real"
        HTML element, so that browsers and other tools that don't know of the extension can still
        support it somewhat well. This is the tack used by microformats, for example.

    * Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts
        to process using the <code>data-*=""</code> attributes. These are guaranteed
        to never be touched by browsers, and allow scripts to include data on HTML elements that
        scripts can then look for and process.

    * Authors can use the <code>&lt;meta name="" content=""></code> mechanism to
        include page-wide metadata by registering <span data-x="concept-meta-extensions">extensions
        to the predefined set of metadata names</span>.

    * Authors can use the <code>rel=""</code> mechanism to annotate
        links with specific meanings by registering <span data-x="concept-rel-extensions">extensions
        to the predefined set of link types</span>. This is also used by microformats. Additionally,
        absolute URLs that do not contain any non-ASCII characters, nor characters in the range
        U+0041 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A) through U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z) (inclusive), may be
        used as link types.

    * Authors can embed raw data using the <code>&lt;script type=""></code> mechanism with a custom
        type, for further handling by inline or server-side scripts.

    * Authors can create <span data-x="plugin">plugins</span> and invoke them using the
        <{embed}> element. This is how Flash works.

    * Authors can extend APIs using the JavaScript prototyping mechanism. This is widely used by
        script libraries, for instance.

<h3 id="html-vs-xhtml">HTML vs XHTML</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>


    This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications, and
    some APIs for interacting with in-memory representations of resources that use this language.


    The in-memory representation is known as "DOM HTML", or "the DOM" for short.

    There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this
    abstract language, two of which are defined in this specification.

    The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax. This is the format suggested for most
    authors. It is compatible with most legacy Web browsers. If a document is transmitted with the
    <code>text/html</code> <span>MIME type</span>, then it will be processed as an HTML document by
    Web browsers. This specification defines version [LEVEL] of the HTML syntax, known as
    "HTML[LEVEL]".

    The second concrete syntax is the XHTML syntax, which is an application of XML. When a document
    is transmitted with an <span>XML MIME type</span>, such as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>,
    then it is treated as an XML document by Web browsers, to be parsed by an XML processor. Authors
    are reminded that the processing for XML and HTML differs; in particular, even minor syntax
    errors will prevent a document labeled as XML from being rendered fully, whereas they would be
    ignored in the HTML syntax. This specification defines version [LEVEL] of the XHTML syntax,
    known as "XHTML[LEVEL]".

    The DOM, the HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax cannot all represent the same content. For
    example, namespaces cannot be represented using the HTML syntax, but they are supported in the
    DOM and in the XHTML syntax. Similarly, documents that use the <code>noscript</code> feature can
    be represented using the HTML syntax, but cannot be represented with the DOM or in the XHTML
    syntax. Comments that contain the string "<code>--&gt;</code>" can only be represented in the
    DOM, not in the HTML and XHTML syntaxes.

<h3 id="structure-of-this-specification">Structure of this specification</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    <p>This specification is divided into the following major sections:</p>

    <div dfn-for="spec">
        : [[#introduction]]
        :: Non-normative materials providing a context for the HTML standard.

        : [[#infrastructure]]
        :: The conformance classes, algorithms, definitions, and the common underpinnings of the
            rest of the specification.

        : [[#dom]]
        :: Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree using the DOM. This section
            defines the features of this DOM, as well as introducing the features common to all
            elements, and the concepts used in defining elements.

        : [[#semantics]]
        :: Each element has a predefined meaning, which is explained in this section. Rules for
            authors on how to use the element<span class="impl">, along with user agent requirements
            for how to handle each element,</span> are also given. This includes large signature
            features of HTML such as video playback and subtitles, form controls and form
            submission, and a 2D graphics API known as the HTML canvas.

        : [[#editing]]
        :: HTML documents can provide a number of mechanisms for users to interact with and modify
            content, which are described in this section, such as how focus works, and
            drag-and-drop.

        : [[#browsers]]
        :: HTML documents do not exist in a vacuum &mdash; this section defines many of the features
            that affect environments that deal with multiple pages, such as Web browsers and offline
            caching of Web applications.

        : [[#webappapis]]
        :: This section introduces basic features for scripting of applications in HTML.

        : [[#syntax]]
        : [[#xhtml]]
        :: All of these features would be for naught if they couldn't be represented in a serialized
            form and sent to other people, and so these sections define the syntaxes of HTML and
            XHTML<span class="impl">, along with rules for how to parse content using those
            syntaxes</span>.

        : [[#rendering]]
        :: This section defines the default rendering rules for Web browsers.

        There are also some appendices, listing <a>obsolete features</a> and
        <a>IANA considerations</a>, and several indices.
    </div>

<h4 id="how-to-read-this-specification">How to read this specification</h4>

    This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read
      cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it
      should be read by picking random sections from the contents list and following all the
      cross-references.

    As described in the conformance requirements section below, this specification describes
    conformance criteria for a variety of conformance classes. In particular, there are conformance
    requirements that apply to <em>producers</em>, for example authors and the documents they
    create, and there are conformance requirements that apply to <em>consumers</em>, for example Web
    browsers. They can be distinguished by what they are requiring: a requirement on a producer
    states what is allowed, while a requirement on a consumer states how software is to act.

    <div class="example">
        For example, "the <code>foo</code> attribute's value must be a <a>valid integer</a>" is a
        requirement on producers, as it lays out the allowed values; in contrast, the requirement "the
        <code>foo</code> attribute's value must be parsed using the <a>rules for parsing integers</a>"
        is a requirement on consumers, as it describes how to process the content.
    </div>

    <strong>Requirements on producers have no bearing whatsoever on consumers.</strong>

    <div class="example">
        Continuing the above example, a requirement stating that a particular attribute's value is
        constrained to being a <span>valid integer</span> emphatically does <em>not</em> imply
        anything about the requirements on consumers. It might be that the consumers are in fact
        required to treat the attribute as an opaque string, completely unaffected by whether the
        value conforms to the requirements or not. It might be (as in the previous example) that the
        consumers are required to parse the value using specific rules that define how invalid
        (non-numeric in this case) values are to be processed.
    </div>

    <div dfn-for="conventions">

        requirements. In such cases, the requirements that apply to a condition are always the first
        set of requirements that follow the condition, even in the case of there being multiple sets
        of conditions for those requirements. Such cases are presented as follows:

        <dl class="switch">

            <dt>This is another condition</dt>

            <dd>This is the requirement that applies to the third condition.</dd>
        </dl>
    </div>

<h3 id="fingerprint">Privacy concerns</h3>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    Some features of HTML trade user convenience for a measure of user privacy.

    In general, due to the Internet's architecture, a user can be distinguished from another by the
    user's IP address. IP addresses do not perfectly match to a user; as a user moves from device to
    device, or from network to network, their IP address will change; similarly, NAT routing, proxy
    servers, and shared computers enable packets that appear to all come from a single IP address to
    actually map to multiple users. Technologies such as onion routing can be used to further
    anonymize requests so that requests from a single user at one node on the Internet appear to come
    from many disparate parts of the network.

    However, the IP address used for a user's requests is not the only mechanism by which a user's
    requests could be related to each other. Cookies, for example, are designed specifically to enable
    this, and are the basis of most of the Web's session features that enable you to log into a site
    with which you have an account.

    There are other mechanisms that are more subtle. Certain characteristics of a user's system can
    be used to distinguish groups of users from each other; by collecting enough such information, an
    individual user's browser's "digital fingerprint" can be computed, which can be as good, if not
    better, as an IP address in ascertaining which requests are from the same user.

    Grouping requests in this manner, especially across multiple sites, can be used for both benign
    (and even arguably positive) purposes, as well as for malevolent purposes. An example of a
    reasonably benign purpose would be determining whether a particular person seems to prefer sites
    with dog illustrations as opposed to sites with cat illustrations (based on how often they visit
    the sites in question) and then automatically using the preferred illustrations on subsequent
    visits to participating sites. Malevolent purposes, however, could include governments combining
    information such as the person's home address (determined from the addresses they use when getting
    driving directions on one site) with their apparent political affiliations (determined by
    examining the forum sites that they participate in) to determine whether the person should be
    prevented from voting in an election.

    Since the malevolent purposes can be remarkably evil, user agent implementors are encouraged to
    consider how to provide their users with tools to minimize leaking information that could be used
    to fingerprint a user.

    Unfortunately, as the first paragraph in this section implies, sometimes there is great benefit
    to be derived from exposing the very information that can also be used for fingerprinting
    purposes, so it's not as easy as simply blocking all possible leaks. For instance, the ability to
    log into a site to post under a specific identity requires that the user's requests be
    identifiable as all being from the same user, more or less by definition. More subtly, though,
    information such as how wide text is, which is necessary for many effects that involve drawing
    text onto a canvas (e.g. any effect that involves drawing a border around the text) also leaks
    information that can be used to group a user's requests. (In this case, by potentially exposing,
    via a brute force search, which fonts a user has installed, information which can vary
    considerably from user to user.)

    Features in this specification which can be <dfn id="fingerprinting-vector">used to
    fingerprint the user</dfn> are marked as this paragraph is.
    <span class="fingerprint"><a href="#fingerprinting-vector"><img height="21" src="images/fingerprint.png" width="15" alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" /></a></span>

    Other features in the platform can be used for the same purpose, though, including, though not
    limited to:


    * The exact list of which features a user agents supports.

    * The maximum allowed stack depth for recursion in script.

    * Features that describe the user's environment, like Media Queries and the <code>Screen</code>
        object. [[!MEDIAQ]] [[!CSSOM-VIEW]]

    * The user's time zone.

      &lt;p>This is a &lt;a href="demo.html">simple&lt;/a> sample.&lt;/p>
      &lt;!-- this is a comment -->
     &lt;/body>
    &lt;/html></pre>

    HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text. Each element is denoted in the source by
    a <a>start tag</a>, such as "<code>&lt;body></code>", and an <a>end tag</a>, such as
    "<code>&lt;/body></code>". (Certain start tags and end tags can in certain cases be
    <a>omitted</a> and are implied by other tags.)

    Tags have to be nested such that elements are all completely within each other, without
    overlapping:

    <pre class="bad" highlight="html">&lt;p>This is &lt;em>very &lt;strong>wrong&lt;/em>!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></pre>
    <pre highlight="html">&lt;p>This &lt;em>is &lt;strong>correct&lt;/strong>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></pre>

    This specification defines a set of elements that can be used in HTML, along with rules about
    the ways in which the elements can be nested.

    Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. In the example below, there
    is a <a>hyperlink</a>, formed using the <code>a</code> element and its <code>href</code>
    attribute:

    <pre highlight="html">&lt;a href="demo.html">simple&lt;/a></pre>

    <a>Attributes</a> are placed inside the start tag, and consist of a <a>name</a> and a
    <a>value</a>, separated by an "<code>=</code>" character. The attribute value can remain
    <a>unquoted</a> if it doesn't contain <a>space characters</a> or any of <code>"</code>
    <code>'</code> <code>`</code> <code>=</code> <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code>. Otherwise,
    it has to be quoted using either single or double quotes. The value, along with the
    "<code>=</code>" character, can be omitted altogether if the value is the empty string.
<pre class="link-defaults">
spec:dom-ls; type:dfn; for:Attr; text:name
</pre>
    <pre highlight="html">&lt;!-- empty attributes -->
    &lt;input name=address disabled>
    &lt;input name=address disabled="">

    &lt;!-- attributes with a value -->
    &lt;input name=address maxlength=200>
    &lt;input name=address maxlength='200'>
    &lt;input name=address maxlength="200"></pre>

    HTML user agents (e.g. Web browsers) then <i>parse</i> this markup, turning it into a DOM
    (Document Object Model) tree. A DOM tree is an in-memory representation of a document.

    DOM trees contain several kinds of nodes, in particular a <code>DocumentType</code> node,
    <code>Element</code> nodes, <code>Text</code> nodes, <code>Comment</code> nodes, and in some
    cases <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> nodes.

    The <a>markup snippet at the top of this section</a> would be turned
    into the following DOM tree:

    <ul class="domTree">
        <li class="t10">DOCTYPE: <code>html</code></li>
        <li class="t1"><code>html</code>
            <ul>
                <li class="t1"><code>head</code>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>&#x23CE;&#x2423;&#x2423;</span></li>
                        <li class="t1"><code>title</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>Sample page</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>&#x23CE;&#x2423;</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>&#x23CE;&#x2423;</span></li>
                <li class="t1"><code>body</code>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>&#x23CE;&#x2423;&#x2423;</span></li>
                        <li class="t1"><code>h1</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>Sample page</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>&#x23CE;&#x2423;&#x2423;</span></li>
                        <li class="t1"><code>p</code>
                            <ul>
                                <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>This is a &lt;!--grammar-check-override--></span></li>
                                <li class="t1"><code>a</code> <span class="t2"><code class="attribute name" data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code>="<code class="attribute value">demo.html</code>"</span>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>simple</span></li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span> sample.</span></li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>&#x23CE;&#x2423;&#x2423;</span></li>
                        <li class="t8"><code>#comment</code>: <span> this is a comment </span></li>
                        <li class="t3"><code>#text</code>: <span>&#x23CE;&#x2423;&#x23CE;</span></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    The <span>root element</span> of this tree is the <code>html</code> element, which is the
    element always found at the root of HTML documents. It contains two elements, <code>head</code>
    and <code>body</code>, as well as a <code>Text</code> node between them.

    There are many more <code>Text</code> nodes in the DOM tree than one would initially expect,
    because the source contains a number of spaces (represented here by "&#x2423;") and line breaks
    ("&#x23CE;") that all end up as <code>Text</code> nodes in the DOM. However, for historical
    reasons not all of the spaces and line breaks in the original markup appear in the DOM. In
    particular, all the whitespace before <code>head</code> start tag ends up being dropped
    silently, and all the whitespace after the <code>body</code> end tag ends up placed at the end
    of the <code>body</code>.

    The <code>head</code> element contains a <code>title</code> element, which itself contains a
    <code>Text</code> node with the text "Sample page". Similarly, the <code>body</code> element
    contains an <code>h1</code> element, a <code>p</code> element, and a comment.

    <hr />

    This DOM tree can be manipulated from scripts in the page. Scripts (typically in JavaScript)
    are small programs that can be embedded using the <code>script</code> element or using
    <span>event handler content attributes</span>. For example, here is a form with a script that
    sets the value of the form's <code>output</code> element to say "Hello World"

    <pre highlight="html">&lt;form name="main">
     Result: &lt;output name="result">&lt;/output>
     &lt;script>
      document.forms.main.elements.result.value = 'Hello World';
     &lt;/script>
    &lt;/form></pre>

    Each element in the DOM tree is represented by an object, and these objects have APIs so that
    they can be manipulated. For instance, a link (e.g. the <code>a</code> element in the tree
    above) can have its "<code data-x="attr-hyperlink-href">href</code>" attribute changed in
    several ways:

    <pre highlight="javascript">var a = document.links[0]; // obtain the first link in the document
    a.href = 'sample.html'; // change the destination URL of the link
    a.protocol = 'https'; // change just the scheme part of the URL
    a.setAttribute('href', 'http://example.com/'); // change the content attribute directly</pre>

    Since DOM trees are used as the way to represent HTML documents when they are processed and
    presented by implementations (especially interactive implementations like Web browsers), this
    specification is mostly phrased in terms of DOM trees, instead of the markup described above.

    <hr />

    HTML documents represent a media-independent description of interactive content. HTML documents
    might be rendered to a screen, or through a speech synthesizer, or on a braille display. To
    influence exactly how such rendering takes place, authors can use a styling language such as
    CSS.

    In the following example, the page has been made yellow-on-blue using CSS.

    <pre highlight=html>&lt;!DOCTYPE html>
    &lt;html>
     &lt;head>
      &lt;title>Sample styled page&lt;/title>
      &lt;style>
       body { background: navy; color: yellow; }
      &lt;/style>
     &lt;/head>
     &lt;body>
      &lt;h1>Sample styled page&lt;/h1>
      &lt;p>This page is just a demo.&lt;/p>
     &lt;/body>
    &lt;/html></pre>

    For more details on how to use HTML, authors are encouraged to consult tutorials and guides.
    Some of the examples included in this specification might also be of use, but the novice author
    is cautioned that this specification, by necessity, defines the language with a level of detail
    that might be difficult to understand at first.

<h4 id="writing-secure-applications-with-html">Writing secure applications with HTML</h4>

    <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

    When HTML is used to create interactive sites, care needs to be taken to avoid introducing
    vulnerabilities through which attackers can compromise the integrity of the site itself or of
    the site's users.

    A comprehensive study of this matter is beyond the scope of this document, and authors are
    strongly encouraged to study the matter in more detail. However, this section attempts to
    provide a quick introduction to some common pitfalls in HTML application development.

    The security model of the Web is based on the concept of "origins", and correspondingly many of
    the potential attacks on the Web involve cross-origin actions. [[!ORIGIN]]

    <dl>
        <dt>Not validating user input</dt>
        <dt>Cross-site scripting (XSS)</dt>
        <dt>SQL injection</dt>
        <dd>
        When accepting untrusted input, e.g. user-generated content such as text comments, values in
        URL parameters, messages from third-party sites, etc, it is imperative that the data be
        validated before use, and properly escaped when displayed. Failing to do this can allow a
        hostile user to perform a variety of attacks, ranging from the potentially benign, such as
        providing bogus user information like a negative age, to the serious, such as running scripts
        every time a user looks at a page that includes the information, potentially propagating the
        attack in the process, to the catastrophic, such as deleting all data in the server.

        When writing filters to validate user input, it is imperative that filters always be
        safelist-based, allowing known-safe constructs and disallowing all other input. Blocklist-based
        filters that disallow known-bad inputs and allow everything else are not secure, as not
        everything that is bad is yet known (for example, because it might be invented in the
        future).

        <div class="example">
            For example, suppose a page looked at its URL's query string to determine what to display,
            and the site then redirected the user to that page to display a message, as in:

            <pre highlight="html">&lt;ul>
             &lt;li>&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Hello">Say Hello&lt;/a>
             &lt;li>&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Welcome">Say Welcome&lt;/a>
             &lt;li>&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Kittens">Say Kittens&lt;/a>
            &lt;/ul></pre>

            If the message was just displayed to the user without escaping, a hostile attacker could
            then craft a URL that contained a script element:

            <pre>http://example.com/message.cgi?say=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27Oh%20no%21%27%29%3C/script%3E</pre>

            If the attacker then convinced a victim user to visit this page, a script of the
            attacker's choosing would run on the page. Such a script could do any number of hostile
            actions, limited only by what the site offers: if the site is an e-commerce shop, for
            instance, such a script could cause the user to unknowingly make arbitrarily many
            unwanted purchases.

            This is called a cross-site scripting attack.
        </div>

        There are many constructs that can be used to try to trick a site into executing code. Here
        are some that authors are encouraged to consider when writing safelist filters:

        * When allowing harmless-seeming elements like <code>img</code>, it is important to safelist
            any provided attributes as well. If one allowed all attributes then an attacker could,
            for instance, use the <code data-x="handler-onload">onload</code> attribute to run
            arbitrary script.

        * When allowing URLs to be provided (e.g. for links), the scheme of each URL also needs to
            be explicitly safelisted, as there are many schemes that can be abused. The most
            prominent example is "<code data-x="javascript protocol">javascript:</code>", but user
            agents can implement (and indeed, have historically implemented) others.

        * Allowing a <code>base</code> element to be inserted means any <code>script</code> elements
            in the page with relative links can be hijacked, and similarly that any form submissions
            can get redirected to a hostile site.
       </dd>

        <dt>Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)</dt>
        <dd>
            If a site allows a user to make form submissions with user-specific side-effects, for
            example posting messages on a forum under the user's name, making purchases, or applying
            for a passport, it is important to verify that the request was made by the user
            intentionally, rather than by another site tricking the user into making the request
            unknowingly.

            This problem exists because HTML forms can be submitted to other origins.

            Sites can prevent such attacks by populating forms with user-specific hidden tokens, or
            by checking <code data-x="http-origin">Origin</code> headers on all requests.
       </dd>

        <dt>Clickjacking</dt>
        <dd>
            A page that provides users with an interface to perform actions that the user might not
            wish to perform needs to be designed so as to avoid the possibility that users can be
            tricked into activating the interface.

            One way that a user could be so tricked is if a hostile site places the victim site in a
            small <code>iframe</code> and then convinces the user to click, for instance by having
            the user play a reaction game. Once the user is playing the game, the hostile site can
            quickly position the iframe under the mouse cursor just as the user is about to click,
            thus tricking the user into clicking the victim site's interface.

            To avoid this, sites that do not expect to be used in frames are encouraged to only
            enable their interface if they detect that they are not in a frame (e.g. by comparing
            the <code>window</code> object to the value of the <code>top</code> attribute).
        </dd>
    </dl>
