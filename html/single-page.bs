Abstract: This specification defines the 5th major version, first minor revision of the core
          language of the World Wide Web: the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In this version,
          new features continue to be introduced to help Web application authors, new elements
          continue to be introduced based on research into prevailing authoring practices, and
          special attention continues to be given to defining clear conformance criteria for user
          agents in an effort to improve interoperability.

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The World Wide Web's markup language has always been HTML. HTML was primarily designed as a
  language for semantically describing scientific documents, although its general design and
  adaptations over the years have enabled it to be used to describe a number of other types of
  documents.

  The main area that has not been adequately addressed by HTML is a vague subject referred to as
  Web Applications. This standard attempts to rectify this, while at the same time updating the HTML
  language to address issues raised in the past few years.

<h3 id="audience">Audience</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This specification is intended for authors of documents and scripts that use the features
  defined in this specification<span class="impl">, implementors of tools that operate on pages
  that use the features defined in this specification, and individuals wishing to establish the
  correctness of documents or implementations with respect to the requirements of this
  specification</span>.

  This document is probably not suited to readers who do not already have at least a passing
  familiarity with Web technologies, as in places it sacrifices clarity for precision, and brevity
  for completeness. More approachable tutorials and authoring guides can provide a gentler
  introduction to the topic.

  In particular, familiarity with the basics of DOM is necessary for a complete understanding of
  some of the more technical parts of this specification. An understanding of Web IDL, HTTP, XML,
  Unicode, character encodings, JavaScript, and CSS will also be helpful in places but is not
  essential.

<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This specification is limited to providing a semantic-level markup language and associated
  semantic-level scripting APIs for authoring accessible pages on the Web ranging from static
  documents to dynamic applications.

  The scope of this specification does not include providing mechanisms for media-specific
  customization of presentation (although default rendering rules for Web browsers are included at
  the end of this specification, and several mechanisms for hooking into CSS are provided as part
  of the language).

  The scope of this specification is not to describe an entire operating system. In particular,
  hardware configuration software, image manipulation tools, and applications that users would be
  expected to use with high-end workstations on a daily basis are out of scope. In terms of
  applications, this specification is targeted specifically at applications that would be expected
  to be used by users on an occasional basis, or regularly but from disparate locations, with low
  CPU requirements. Examples of such applications include online purchasing systems, searching
  systems, games (especially multiplayer online games), public telephone books or address books,
  communications software (e-mail clients, instant messaging clients, discussion software),
  document editing software, etc.

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  For its first five years (1990-1995), HTML went through a number of revisions and experienced a
  number of extensions, primarily hosted first at CERN, and then at the IETF.

  With the creation of the W3C, HTML's development changed venue again. A first abortive attempt at
  extending HTML in 1995 known as HTML 3.0 then made way to a more pragmatic approach known as
  HTML3.2, which was completed in 1997. HTML4 quickly followed later that same year.

  The following year, the W3C membership decided to stop evolving HTML and instead begin work on
  an XML-based equivalent, called XHTML. This effort started with a reformulation of HTML4 in XML,
  known as XHTML 1.0, which added no new features except the new serialization, and which was
  completed in 2000. After XHTML 1.0, the W3C's focus turned to making it easier for other working
  groups to extend XHTML, under the banner of XHTML Modularization. In parallel with this, the W3C
  also worked on a new language that was not compatible with the earlier HTML and XHTML languages,
  calling it XHTML2.

  Around the time that HTML's evolution was stopped in 1998, parts of the API for HTML developed
  by browser vendors were specified and published under the name DOM Level 1 (in 1998) and DOM
  Level 2 Core and DOM Level 2 HTML (starting in 2000 and culminating in 2003). These efforts then
  petered out, with some DOM Level 3 specifications published in 2004 but the working group being
  closed before all the Level 3 drafts were completed.

  In 2003, the publication of XForms, a technology which was positioned as the next generation of
  Web forms, sparked a renewed interest in evolving HTML itself, rather than finding replacements
  for it. This interest was borne from the realization that XML's deployment as a Web technology was
  limited to entirely new technologies (like RSS and later Atom), rather than as a replacement for
  existing deployed technologies (like HTML).

  A proof of concept to show that it was possible to extend HTML4's forms to provide many of the
  features that XForms 1.0 introduced, without requiring browsers to implement rendering engines
  that were incompatible with existing HTML Web pages, was the first result of this renewed
  interest. At this early stage, while the draft was already publicly available, and input was
  already being solicited from all sources, the specification was only under Opera Software's
  copyright.

  The idea that HTML's evolution should be reopened was tested at a W3C workshop in 2004, where
  some of the principles that underlie the HTML5 work (described below), as well as the
  aforementioned early draft proposal covering just forms-related features, were presented to the
  W3C jointly by Mozilla and Opera. The proposal was rejected on the grounds that the proposal
  conflicted with the previously chosen direction for the Web's evolution; the W3C staff and
  membership voted to continue developing XML-based replacements instead.

  Shortly thereafter, Apple, Mozilla, and Opera jointly announced their intent to continue working
  on the effort under the umbrella of a new venue called the WHATWG. A public mailing list was
  created, and the draft was moved to the WHATWG site. The copyright was subsequently amended to be
  jointly owned by all three vendors, and to allow reuse of the specification.

  The WHATWG was based on several core principles, in particular that technologies need to be
  backwards compatible, that specifications and implementations need to match even if this means
  changing the specification rather than the implementations, and that specifications need to be
  detailed enough that implementations can achieve complete interoperability without
  reverse-engineering each other.

  The latter requirement in particular required that the scope of the HTML5 specification include
  what had previously been specified in three separate documents: HTML4, XHTML1, and DOM2 HTML. It
  also meant including significantly more detail than had previously been considered the norm.

  In 2006, the W3C indicated an interest to participate in the development of HTML5 after all, and
  in 2007 formed a working group chartered to work with the WHATWG on the development of the HTML5
  specification. Apple, Mozilla, and Opera allowed the W3C to publish the specification under the
  W3C copyright, while keeping a version with the less restrictive license on the WHATWG site.

  For a number of years, both groups then worked together under the same editor: Ian Hickson. In
  2011, the groups came to the conclusion that they had different goals: the W3C wanted to draw a
  line in the sand for features for a HTML5 Recommendation, while the WHATWG wanted to continue
  working on a Living Standard for HTML, continuously maintaining the specification and adding new
  features. In mid 2012, a new editing team was introduced at the W3C to take care of creating a
  HTML5 Recommendation and prepare a Working Draft for the next HTML version.

  Since then, the W3C HTML WG has been cherry picking patches from the WHATWG that resolved bugs
  registered on the W3C HTML specification or more accurately represented implemented reality in
  UAs. At time of publication of this document, patches from the <a>WHATWG HTML specification</a>
  have been merged until revision <a>8424</a> inclusive. The W3C HTML editors have also added
  patches that resulted from discussions and decisions made by the W3C HTML WG as well a bug fixes
  from bugs not shared by the WHATWG.

  A separate document is published to document the differences between the HTML specified in this
  document and the language described in the HTML4 specification. [[HTML5-DIFF]]

<h3 id="design-notes">Design notes</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  It must be admitted that many aspects of HTML appear at first glance to be nonsensical and
  inconsistent.

  HTML, its supporting DOM APIs, as well as many of its supporting technologies, have been
  developed over a period of several decades by a wide array of people with different priorities
  who, in many cases, did not know of each other's existence.

  Features have thus arisen from many sources, and have not always been designed in especially
  consistent ways. Furthermore, because of the unique characteristics of the Web, implementation
  bugs have often become de-facto, and now de-jure, standards, as content is often unintentionally
  written in ways that rely on them before they can be fixed.

  Despite all this, efforts have been made to adhere to certain design goals. These are described
  in the next few subsections.

<h4 id="serializability-of-script-execution">Serializability of script execution</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  To avoid exposing Web authors to the complexities of multithreading, the HTML and DOM APIs are
  designed such that no script can ever detect the simultaneous execution of other scripts. Even
  with <a>workers</a>, the intent is that the behavior of implementations
  can be thought of as completely serializing the execution of all scripts in all
  <a>browsing contexts</a>.

  <p class="note">
    The <code>navigator.yieldForStorageUpdates()</code> method, in this model, is equivalent to
    allowing other scripts to run while the calling script is blocked.
  </p>

<h4 id="compliance-with-other-specifications">Compliance with other specifications</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This specification interacts with and relies on a wide variety of other specifications. In certain
  circumstances, unfortunately, conflicting needs have led to this specification violating the
  requirements of these other specifications. Whenever this has occurred, the transgressions have
  each been noted as a "<dfn>willful violation</dfn>", and the reason for the violation has been
  noted.

<h4 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  HTML has a wide array of extensibility mechanisms that can be used for adding semantics in a safe
  manner:

  * Authors can use the <code>class</code> attribute to extend elements, effectively creating their
    own elements, while using the most applicable existing "real" HTML element, so that browsers and
    other tools that don't know of the extension can still support it somewhat well. This is the
    tack used by microformats, for example.

  * Authors can include data for inline client-side scripts or server-side site-wide scripts to
    process using the <code>data-*=""</code> attributes. These are guaranteed to never be touched by
    browsers, and allow scripts to include data on HTML elements that scripts can then look for and
    process.

  * Authors can use the <code>&lt;meta name="" content=""></code> mechanism to
    include page-wide metadata by registering <a>extensions to the predefined set of metadata
    names</a>.

  * Authors can use the <code>rel=""</code> mechanism to annotate links with specific meanings by
    registering <a>extensions to the predefined set of link types</a>. This is also used by
    microformats. Additionally, absolute URLs that do not contain any non-ASCII characters, nor
    characters in the range U+0041 (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A) through U+005A (LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z)
    (inclusive), may be used as link types.

  * Authors can embed raw data using the <code>&lt;script type=""></code> mechanism with a custom
    type, for further handling by inline or server-side scripts.

  * Authors can create <a>plugins</a> and invoke them using the <{embed}> element. This is how Flash
    works.

  * Authors can extend APIs using the JavaScript prototyping mechanism. This is widely used by
    script libraries, for instance.

<h3 id="html-vs-xhtml">HTML vs XHTML</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This specification defines an abstract language for describing documents and applications, and
  some APIs for interacting with in-memory representations of resources that use this language.


  The in-memory representation is known as "DOM HTML", or "the DOM" for short.

  There are various concrete syntaxes that can be used to transmit resources that use this abstract
  language, two of which are defined in this specification.

  The first such concrete syntax is the HTML syntax. This is the format suggested for most authors.
  It is compatible with most legacy Web browsers. If a document is transmitted with the
  <code>text/html</code> <a>MIME type</a>, then it will be processed as an HTML document by Web
  browsers. This specification defines version [LEVEL] of the HTML syntax, known as "HTML[LEVEL]".

  The second concrete syntax is the XHTML syntax, which is an application of XML. When a document
  is transmitted with an <a>XML MIME type</a>, such as <code>application/xhtml+xml</code>,
  then it is treated as an XML document by Web browsers, to be parsed by an XML processor. Authors
  are reminded that the processing for XML and HTML differs; in particular, even minor syntax
  errors will prevent a document labeled as XML from being rendered fully, whereas they would be
  ignored in the HTML syntax. This specification defines version [LEVEL] of the XHTML syntax,
  known as "XHTML[LEVEL]".

  The DOM, the HTML syntax, and the XHTML syntax cannot all represent the same content. For
  example, namespaces cannot be represented using the HTML syntax, but they are supported in the
  DOM and in the XHTML syntax. Similarly, documents that use the <code>noscript</code> feature can
  be represented using the HTML syntax, but cannot be represented with the DOM or in the XHTML
  syntax. Comments that contain the string "<code>--&gt;</code>" can only be represented in the
  DOM, not in the HTML and XHTML syntaxes.

<h3 id="structure-of-this-specification">Structure of this specification</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  This specification is divided into the following major sections:

  <div dfn-for="spec">
    : [[#introduction]]
    :: Non-normative materials providing a context for the HTML standard.

    : [[#infrastructure]]
    :: The conformance classes, algorithms, definitions, and the common underpinnings of the rest of
        the specification.

    : [[#dom]]
    :: Documents are built from elements. These elements form a tree using the DOM. This section
        defines the features of this DOM, as well as introducing the features common to all
        elements, and the concepts used in defining elements.

    : [[#semantics]]
    :: Each element has a predefined meaning, which is explained in this section. Rules for authors
        on how to use the element<span class="impl">, along with user agent requirements for how to
        handle each element,</span> are also given. This includes large signature features of HTML
        such as video playback and subtitles, form controls and form submission, and a 2D graphics
        API known as the HTML canvas.

    : [[#editing]]
    :: HTML documents can provide a number of mechanisms for users to interact with and modify
        content, which are described in this section, such as how focus works, and drag-and-drop.

    : [[#browsers]]
    :: HTML documents do not exist in a vacuum &mdash; this section defines many of the features
        that affect environments that deal with multiple pages, such as Web browsers and offline
        caching of Web applications.

    : [[#webappapis]]
    :: This section introduces basic features for scripting of applications in HTML.

    : [[#syntax]]
    : [[#xhtml]]
    :: All of these features would be for naught if they couldn't be represented in a serialized
        form and sent to other people, and so these sections define the syntaxes of HTML and
        XHTML<span class="impl">, along with rules for how to parse content using those
        syntaxes</span>.

    : [[#rendering]]
    :: This section defines the default rendering rules for Web browsers.

    There are also some appendices, listing <a>obsolete features</a> and <a>IANA considerations</a>,
    and several indices.
  </div>

<h4 id="how-to-read-this-specification">How to read this specification</h4>

  This specification should be read like all other specifications. First, it should be read
  cover-to-cover, multiple times. Then, it should be read backwards at least once. Then it should be
  read by picking random sections from the contents list and following all the cross-references.

  As described in the conformance requirements section below, this specification describes
  conformance criteria for a variety of conformance classes. In particular, there are conformance
  requirements that apply to <em>producers</em>, for example authors and the documents they create,
  and there are conformance requirements that apply to <em>consumers</em>, for example Web browsers.
  They can be distinguished by what they are requiring: a requirement on a producer states what is
  allowed, while a requirement on a consumer states how software is to act.

  <div class="example">
    For example, "the <code>foo</code> attribute's value must be a <a>valid integer</a>" is a
    requirement on producers, as it lays out the allowed values; in contrast, the requirement "the
    <code>foo</code> attribute's value must be parsed using the <a>rules for parsing integers</a>"
    is a requirement on consumers, as it describes how to process the content.
  </div>

  <strong>Requirements on producers have no bearing whatsoever on consumers.</strong>

  <div class="example">
    Continuing the above example, a requirement stating that a particular attribute's value is
    constrained to being a <a>valid integer</a> emphatically does <em>not</em> imply anything about
    the requirements on consumers. It might be that the consumers are in fact required to treat the
    attribute as an opaque string, completely unaffected by whether the value conforms to the
    requirements or not. It might be (as in the previous example) that the consumers are required to
    parse the value using specific rules that define how invalid (non-numeric in this case) values
    are to be processed.
  </div>

    </dl>
  </div>

<h3 id="fingerprint">Privacy concerns</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Some features of HTML trade user convenience for a measure of user privacy.

  In general, due to the Internet's architecture, a user can be distinguished from another by the
  user's IP address. IP addresses do not perfectly match to a user; as a user moves from device to
  device, or from network to network, their IP address will change; similarly, NAT routing, proxy
  servers, and shared computers enable packets that appear to all come from a single IP address to
  actually map to multiple users. Technologies such as onion routing can be used to further
  anonymize requests so that requests from a single user at one node on the Internet appear to come
  from many disparate parts of the network.

  However, the IP address used for a user's requests is not the only mechanism by which a user's
  requests could be related to each other. Cookies, for example, are designed specifically to enable
  this, and are the basis of most of the Web's session features that enable you to log into a site
  with which you have an account.

  There are other mechanisms that are more subtle. Certain characteristics of a user's system can be
  used to distinguish groups of users from each other; by collecting enough such information, an
  individual user's browser's "digital fingerprint" can be computed, which can be as good, if not
  better, as an IP address in ascertaining which requests are from the same user.

  Grouping requests in this manner, especially across multiple sites, can be used for both benign
  (and even arguably positive) purposes, as well as for malevolent purposes. An example of a
  reasonably benign purpose would be determining whether a particular person seems to prefer sites
  with dog illustrations as opposed to sites with cat illustrations (based on how often they visit
  the sites in question) and then automatically using the preferred illustrations on subsequent
  visits to participating sites. Malevolent purposes, however, could include governments combining
  information such as the person's home address (determined from the addresses they use when getting
  driving directions on one site) with their apparent political affiliations (determined by
  examining the forum sites that they participate in) to determine whether the person should be
  prevented from voting in an election.

  Since the malevolent purposes can be remarkably evil, user agent implementors are encouraged to
  consider how to provide their users with tools to minimize leaking information that could be used
  to fingerprint a user.

  Unfortunately, as the first paragraph in this section implies, sometimes there is great benefit
  to be derived from exposing the very information that can also be used for fingerprinting
  purposes, so it's not as easy as simply blocking all possible leaks. For instance, the ability to
  log into a site to post under a specific identity requires that the user's requests be
  identifiable as all being from the same user, more or less by definition. More subtly, though,
  information such as how wide text is, which is necessary for many effects that involve drawing
  text onto a canvas (e.g. any effect that involves drawing a border around the text) also leaks
  information that can be used to group a user's requests. (In this case, by potentially exposing,
  via a brute force search, which fonts a user has installed, information which can vary
  considerably from user to user.)

  Features in this specification which can be <dfn id="fingerprinting-vector">used to fingerprint
  the user</dfn> are marked as this paragraph is.
  <a class="fingerprint" href="#fingerprinting-vector"><img height="21" src="images/fingerprint.png" width="15" alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" /></a>

  Other features in the platform can be used for the same purpose, though, including, though not
  limited to:

  * The exact list of which features a user agents supports.

  * The maximum allowed stack depth for recursion in script.

  * Features that describe the user's environment, like Media Queries and the <code>Screen</code>
    object. [[!MEDIAQ]] [[!CSSOM-VIEW]]

  * The user's time zone.

<h3 id="a-quick-introduction-to-html">A quick introduction to HTML</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  A basic HTML document looks like this:

  <pre id="intro-early-example" highlight="html">
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
    &lt;html>
      &lt;head>
        &lt;title>Sample page&lt;/title>
      &lt;/head>
      &lt;body>
        &lt;h1>Sample page&lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>This is a &lt;a href="demo.html">simple&lt;/a> sample.&lt;/p>
        &lt;!-- this is a comment -->
      &lt;/body>
    &lt;/html>
  </pre>

  HTML documents consist of a tree of elements and text. Each element is denoted in the source by
  a <a>start tag</a>, such as "<code>&lt;body></code>", and an <a>end tag</a>, such as
  "<code>&lt;/body></code>". (Certain start tags and end tags can in certain cases be <a>omitted</a>
  and are implied by other tags.)

  Tags have to be nested such that elements are all completely within each other, without
  overlapping:

  <pre class="bad" highlight="html">&lt;p>This is &lt;em>very &lt;strong>wrong&lt;/em>!&lt;/strong>&lt;/p></pre>
  <pre highlight="html">&lt;p>This &lt;em>is &lt;strong>correct&lt;/strong>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></pre>

  This specification defines a set of elements that can be used in HTML, along with rules about the
  ways in which the elements can be nested.

  Elements can have attributes, which control how the elements work. In the example below, there
  is a <a>hyperlink</a>, formed using the <code>a</code> element and its <code>href</code>
  attribute:

  <pre highlight="html">&lt;a href="demo.html">simple&lt;/a></pre>

  <a>Attributes</a> are placed inside the start tag, and consist of a <a>name</a> and a
  <a>value</a>, separated by an "<code>=</code>" character. The attribute value can remain
  <a>unquoted</a> if it doesn't contain <a>space characters</a> or any of <code>"</code>
  <code>'</code> <code>`</code> <code>=</code> <code>&lt;</code> or <code>&gt;</code>. Otherwise,
  it has to be quoted using either single or double quotes. The value, along with the
  "<code>=</code>" character, can be omitted altogether if the value is the empty string.

  <pre highlight="html">
    &lt;!-- empty attributes -->
    &lt;input name=address disabled>
    &lt;input name=address disabled="">

    &lt;!-- attributes with a value -->
    &lt;input name=address maxlength=200>
    &lt;input name=address maxlength='200'>
    &lt;input name=address maxlength="200">
  </pre>

  HTML user agents (e.g. Web browsers) then <i>parse</i> this markup, turning it into a DOM
  (Document Object Model) tree. A DOM tree is an in-memory representation of a document.

  DOM trees contain several kinds of nodes, in particular a <code>DocumentType</code> node,
  <code>Element</code> nodes, <code>Text</code> nodes, <code>Comment</code> nodes, and in some
  cases <code>ProcessingInstruction</code> nodes.

  The <a>markup snippet at the top of this section</a> would be turned into the following DOM tree:

  <ul class="domTree">
    <li class="t10">DOCTYPE: <code>html</code></li>
    <li class="t1">

        </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  The <a>root element</a> of this tree is the <{html}> element, which is the element always found at
  the root of HTML documents. It contains two elements, <{head}> and <{body}>, as well as a
  <code>Text</code> node between them.

  There are many more <code>Text</code> nodes in the DOM tree than one would initially expect,
  because the source contains a number of spaces (represented here by "&#x2423;") and line breaks
  ("&#x23CE;") that all end up as <code>Text</code> nodes in the DOM. However, for historical
  reasons not all of the spaces and line breaks in the original markup appear in the DOM. In
  particular, all the whitespace before <{head}> start tag ends up being dropped silently, and all
  the whitespace after the <{body}> end tag ends up placed at the end of the <{body}>.

  The <{head}> element contains a <{title}> element, which itself contains a <code>Text</code> node
  with the text "Sample page". Similarly, the <{body}> element contains an {{h1}} element, a <{p}>
  element, and a comment.

  <hr />

  This DOM tree can be manipulated from scripts in the page. Scripts (typically in JavaScript)
  are small programs that can be embedded using the <{script}> element or using
  <a>event handler content attributes</a>. For example, here is a form with a script that sets the
  value of the form's <{output}> element to say "Hello World"

  <pre highlight="html">
    &lt;form name="main">
      Result: &lt;output name="result">&lt;/output>
      &lt;script>
        document.forms.main.elements.result.value = 'Hello World';
      &lt;/script>
    &lt;/form>
  </pre>

  Each element in the DOM tree is represented by an object, and these objects have APIs so that
  they can be manipulated. For instance, a link (e.g. the <{a}> element in the tree above) can have
  its "<{a/href}>" attribute changed in several ways:

  <pre highlight="javascript">
    var a = document.links[0]; // obtain the first link in the document
    a.href = 'sample.html'; // change the destination URL of the link
    a.protocol = 'https'; // change just the scheme part of the URL
    a.setAttribute('href', 'http://example.com/'); // change the content attribute directly
  </pre>

  Since DOM trees are used as the way to represent HTML documents when they are processed and
  presented by implementations (especially interactive implementations like Web browsers), this
  specification is mostly phrased in terms of DOM trees, instead of the markup described above.

  <hr />

  HTML documents represent a media-independent description of interactive content. HTML documents
  might be rendered to a screen, or through a speech synthesizer, or on a braille display. To
  influence exactly how such rendering takes place, authors can use a styling language such as CSS.

  In the following example, the page has been made yellow-on-blue using CSS.

  <pre highlight="html">
    &lt;!DOCTYPE html>
    &lt;html>
      &lt;head>
        &lt;title>Sample styled page&lt;/title>
        &lt;style>
          body { background: navy; color: yellow; }
        &lt;/style>
      &lt;/head>
      &lt;body>
        &lt;h1>Sample styled page&lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>This page is just a demo.&lt;/p>
      &lt;/body>
    &lt;/html>
  </pre>

  For more details on how to use HTML, authors are encouraged to consult tutorials and guides. Some
  of the examples included in this specification might also be of use, but the novice author is
  cautioned that this specification, by necessity, defines the language with a level of detail that
  might be difficult to understand at first.

<h4 id="writing-secure-applications-with-html">Writing secure applications with HTML</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  When HTML is used to create interactive sites, care needs to be taken to avoid introducing
  vulnerabilities through which attackers can compromise the integrity of the site itself or of
  the site's users.

  A comprehensive study of this matter is beyond the scope of this document, and authors are
  strongly encouraged to study the matter in more detail. However, this section attempts to provide
  a quick introduction to some common pitfalls in HTML application development.

  The security model of the Web is based on the concept of "origins", and correspondingly many of
  the potential attacks on the Web involve cross-origin actions. [[!ORIGIN]]

  : Not validating user input
  : Cross-site scripting (XSS)
  : SQL injection
  :: When accepting untrusted input, e.g. user-generated content such as text comments, values
      in URL parameters, messages from third-party sites, etc, it is imperative that the data
      be validated before use, and properly escaped when displayed. Failing to do this can
      allow a hostile user to perform a variety of attacks, ranging from the potentially
      benign, such as providing bogus user information like a negative age, to the serious,
      such as running scripts every time a user looks at a page that includes the information,
      potentially propagating the attack in the process, to the catastrophic, such as deleting
      all data in the server.

      When writing filters to validate user input, it is imperative that filters always be
      safelist-based, allowing known-safe constructs and disallowing all other input. Blocklist-based
      filters that disallow known-bad inputs and allow everything else are not secure, as not
      everything that is bad is yet known (for example, because it might be invented in the
      future).

      <div class="example">
        For example, suppose a page looked at its URL's query string to determine what to display,
        and the site then redirected the user to that page to display a message, as in:

        <pre highlight="html">
          &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Hello">Say Hello&lt;/a>
            &lt;li>&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Welcome">Say Welcome&lt;/a>
            &lt;li>&lt;a href="message.cgi?say=Kittens">Say Kittens&lt;/a>
          &lt;/ul>
        </pre>

        If the message was just displayed to the user without escaping, a hostile attacker could
        then craft a URL that contained a script element:

        <pre>http://example.com/message.cgi?say=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27Oh%20no%21%27%29%3C/script%3E</pre>

        If the attacker then convinced a victim user to visit this page, a script of the
        attacker's choosing would run on the page. Such a script could do any number of hostile
        actions, limited only by what the site offers: if the site is an e-commerce shop, for
        instance, such a script could cause the user to unknowingly make arbitrarily many
        unwanted purchases.

        This is called a cross-site scripting attack.
      </div>

      There are many constructs that can be used to try to trick a site into executing code. Here
      are some that authors are encouraged to consider when writing safelist filters:

      * When allowing harmless-seeming elements like <{img}>, it is important to safelist any
        provided attributes as well. If one allowed all attributes then an attacker could, for
        instance, use the <{img/onload}> attribute to run arbitrary script.

      * When allowing URLs to be provided (e.g. for links), the scheme of each URL also needs to be
        explicitly safelisted, as there are many schemes that can be abused. The most prominent
        example is "<code>javascript:</code>", but user agents can implement (and indeed, have
        historically implemented) others.

      * Allowing a <{base}> element to be inserted means any <{script}> elements in the page with
        relative links can be hijacked, and similarly that any form submissions can get redirected
        to a hostile site.

    : Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
    :: If a site allows a user to make form submissions with user-specific side-effects, for example
        posting messages on a forum under the user's name, making purchases, or applying for a
        passport, it is important to verify that the request was made by the user intentionally,
        rather than by another site tricking the user into making the request unknowingly.

        This problem exists because HTML forms can be submitted to other origins.

        Sites can prevent such attacks by populating forms with user-specific hidden tokens, or by
        checking <code>Origin</code> headers on all requests.

    : Clickjacking
    :: A page that provides users with an interface to perform actions that the user might not
        wish to perform needs to be designed so as to avoid the possibility that users can be
        tricked into activating the interface.

        One way that a user could be so tricked is if a hostile site places the victim site in a
        small <{iframe}> and then convinces the user to click, for instance by having the user play
        a reaction game. Once the user is playing the game, the hostile site can quickly position
        the <{iframe}> under the mouse cursor just as the user is about to click, thus tricking the
        user into clicking the victim site's interface.

        To avoid this, sites that do not expect to be used in frames are encouraged to only enable
        their interface if they detect that they are not in a frame (e.g. by comparing the
        <code>window</code> object to the value of the <code>top</code> attribute).

<h4 id="common-pitfalls-to-avoid-when-using-the-scripting-apis">Common pitfalls to avoid when using
the scripting APIs</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Scripts in HTML have "run-to-completion" semantics, meaning that the browser will generally run
  the script uninterrupted before doing anything else, such as firing further events or continuing
  to parse the document.

  On the other hand, parsing of HTML files happens <a>in parallel</a> and incrementally, meaning
  that the parser can pause at any point to let scripts run. This is generally a good thing, but it
  does mean that authors need to be careful to avoid hooking event handlers after the events could
  have possibly fired.

  There are two techniques for doing this reliably: use <a>event handler content attributes</a>, or
  create the element and add the event handlers in the same script. The latter is safe because, as
  mentioned earlier, scripts are run to completion before further events can fire.

  <div class="example">
    One way this could manifest itself is with <{img}> elements and the <code>load</code> event.
    The event could fire as soon as the element has been parsed, especially if the image has already
    been cached (which is common).

    Here, the author uses the <{img/onload}> handler on an <{img}> element to catch the
    <code>load</code> event:

    <pre highlight="html">&lt;img src="games.png" alt="Games" onload="gamesLogoHasLoaded(event)"></pre>

    If the element is being added by script, then so long as the event handlers are added in the
    same script, the event will still not be missed:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;script>
      var img = new Image();
      img.src = 'games.png';
      img.alt = 'Games';
      img.onload = gamesLogoHasLoaded;
      // img.addEventListener('load', gamesLogoHasLoaded, false); // would work also
      &lt;/script>
    </pre>

    However, if the author first created the <code>img</code> element and then in a separate
    script added the event listeners, there's a chance that the <code>load</code> event would be
    fired in between, leading it to be missed:

    <pre class="bad" highlight="html">
      &lt;!-- Do not use this style, it has a race condition! -->
      &lt;img id="games" src="games.png" alt="Games">
      &lt;!-- the 'load' event might fire here while the parser is taking a
          break, in which case you will not see it! -->
      &lt;script>
      var img = document.getElementById('games');
      img.onload = gamesLogoHasLoaded; // might never fire!
      &lt;/script>
    </pre>
  </div>

mistakes when writing HTML: validators and conformance checkers</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Authors are encouraged to make use of conformance checkers (also known as <i>validators</i>) to
  catch common mistakes. The W3C provides a number of online validation services, including the
  <a href="http://validator.w3.org/nu/">Nu Markup Validation Service</a>.

<h3 id="conformance-requirements-for-authors">Conformance requirements for authors</h3>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Unlike previous versions of the HTML specification, this specification defines in some detail the
  required processing for invalid documents as well as valid documents.

  However, even though the processing of invalid content is in most cases well-defined, conformance
  requirements for documents are still important: in practice, interoperability (the situation in
  which all implementations process particular content in a reliable and identical or equivalent
  way) is not the only goal of document conformance requirements. This section details some of the
  more common reasons for still distinguishing between a conforming document and one with errors.

<h4 id="presentational-markup">Presentational markup</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The majority of presentational features from previous versions of HTML are no longer allowed.
  Presentational markup in general has been found to have a number of problems:

  : The use of presentational elements leads to poorer accessibility
  :: While it is possible to use presentational markup in a way that provides users of assistive
      technologies (ATs) with an acceptable experience (e.g. using ARIA), doing so is significantly
      more difficult than doing so when using semantically-appropriate markup. Furthermore, even
      using such techniques doesn't help make pages accessible for non-AT non-graphical users, such
      as users of text-mode browsers.

      Using media-independent markup, on the other hand, provides an easy way for documents to be
      authored in such a way that they work for more users (e.g. text browsers).

  : Higher cost of maintenance
  :: It is significantly easier to maintain a site written in such a way that the markup is
      style-independent. For example, changing the color of a site that uses
      <code>&lt;font&nbsp;color=""></code> throughout requires changes across the entire site,
      whereas a similar change to a site based on CSS can be done by changing a single file.

  : Larger document sizes
  :: Presentational markup tends to be much more redundant, and thus results in larger document
      sizes.

      For those reasons, presentational markup has been removed from HTML in this version. This
      change should not come as a surprise; HTML4 deprecated presentational markup many years ago
      and provided a mode (HTML4 Transitional) to help authors move away from presentational markup;
      later, XHTML 1.1 went further and obsoleted those features altogether.

      The only remaining presentational markup features in HTML are the <code>style</code> attribute
      and the <{style}> element. Use of the <code>style</code> attribute is somewhat discouraged in
      production environments, but it can be useful for rapid prototyping (where its rules can be
      directly moved into a separate style sheet later) and for providing specific styles in unusual
      cases where a separate style sheet would be inconvenient. Similarly, the <{style}> element can
      be useful in syndication or for page-specific styles, but in general an external style sheet
      is likely to be more convenient when the styles apply to multiple pages.

      It is also worth noting that some elements that were previously presentational have been
      redefined in this specification to be media-independent: <{b}>, <{i}>, <{hr}>, <{s}>,
      <{small}>, and <{u}>.

<h4 id="syntax-errors">Syntax errors</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  The syntax of HTML is constrained to avoid a wide variety of problems.

  : Unintuitive error-handling behavior
  :: Certain invalid syntax constructs, when parsed, result in DOM trees that are highly
      unintuitive.

      <div class="example">
        For example, the following markup fragment results in a DOM with an <{hr}> element that is
        an <em>earlier</em> sibling of the corresponding <{table}> element:

        <pre class="bad" highlight="html">&lt;table>&lt;hr>...</pre>
      </div>

  : Errors with optional error recovery
  :: To allow user agents to be used in controlled environments without having to implement the more
      bizarre and convoluted error handling rules, user agents are permitted to fail whenever
      encountering a <a>parse error</a>.

  : Errors where the error-handling behavior is not compatible with streaming user agents
  :: Some error-handling behavior, such as the behavior for the <code>&lt;table>&lt;hr>...</code>
      example mentioned above, are incompatible with streaming user agents (user agents that process
      HTML files in one pass, without storing state). To avoid interoperability problems with such
      user agents, any syntax resulting in such behavior is considered invalid.

  : Errors that can result in infoset coercion
  :: When a user agent based on XML is connected to an HTML parser, it is possible that certain
      invariants that XML enforces, such as comments never containing two consecutive hyphens, will
      be violated by an HTML file. Handling this can require that the parser coerce the HTML DOM
      into an XML-compatible infoset. Most syntax constructs that require such handling are
      considered invalid.

  : Errors that result in disproportionally poor performance
  :: Certain syntax constructs can result in disproportionally poor performance. To discourage the
      use of such constructs, they are typically made non-conforming.

      <div class="example">
        For example, the following markup results in poor performance, since all the unclosed <{i}>
        elements have to be reconstructed in each paragraph, resulting in progressively more
        elements in each paragraph:

        <pre class="bad" highlight="html">
          &lt;p>&lt;i>He dreamt.
          &lt;p>&lt;i>He dreamt that he ate breakfast.
          &lt;p>&lt;i>Then lunch.
          &lt;p>&lt;i>And finally dinner.
        </pre>

        The resulting DOM for this fragment would be:

        <ul class="domTree">
          <li class="t1">
            <code>p</code>
            <ul>
              <li class="t1">
                <code>i</code>

                </ul>
              </li>

  : Errors involving fragile syntax constructs
  :: There are syntax constructs that, for historical reasons, are relatively fragile. To help
      reduce the number of users who accidentally run into such problems, they are made
      non-conforming.

      <div class="example">
        For example, the parsing of certain named character references in attributes happens even
        with the closing semicolon being omitted. It is safe to include an ampersand followed by
        letters that do not form a named character reference, but if the letters are changed to a
        string that <em>does</em> form a named character reference, they will be interpreted as that
        character instead.

        In this fragment, the attribute's value is "<code>?bill&amp;ted</code>":

        <pre class="bad" highlight="html">&lt;a href="?bill&amp;ted">Bill and Ted&lt;/a></pre>

          In the following fragment, however, the attribute's value is actually
          "<code>?art&copy;</code>", <em>not</em> the intended "<code>?art&amp;copy</code>",
          because even without the final semicolon, "<code>&amp;copy</code>" is handled the same
          as "<code>&amp;copy;</code>" and thus gets interpreted as "<code>&copy;</code>":

          <pre class="bad" highlight="html">&lt;a href="?art&amp;copy">Art and Copy&lt;/a></pre>

          To avoid this problem, all named character references are required to end with a
          semicolon, and uses of named character references without a semicolon are flagged as
          errors.

          Thus, the correct way to express the above cases is as follows:

          <pre highlight="html">&lt;a href="?bill&amp;ted">Bill and Ted&lt;/a> &lt;!-- &amp;ted is ok, since it's not a named character reference --></pre>

          <pre highlight="html">&lt;a href="?art&amp;amp;copy">Art and Copy&lt;/a> &lt;!-- the &amp; has to be escaped, since &amp;copy is a named character reference --></pre>
      </div>

  : Errors involving known interoperability problems in legacy user agents
  :: Certain syntax constructs are known to cause especially subtle or serious problems in legacy
      user agents, and are therefore marked as non-conforming to help authors avoid them.

      <p class="example">
        For example, this is why the U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT character (`) is not allowed in unquoted
        attributes. In certain legacy user agents, it is sometimes treated as a quote character.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Another example of this is the DOCTYPE, which is required to trigger <a>no-quirks mode</a>,
        because the behavior of legacy user agents in <a>quirks mode</a> is often largely
        undocumented.
      </p>

  : Errors that risk exposing authors to security attacks
  :: Certain restrictions exist purely to avoid known security problems.

      <p class="example">
        For example, the restriction on using UTF-7 exists purely to avoid authors falling prey to a
        known cross-site-scripting attack using UTF-7. [[RFC2152]]
      </p>

  : Cases where the author's intent is unclear
  :: Markup where the author's intent is very unclear is often made non-conforming. Correcting these
      errors early makes later maintenance easier.

      <div class="example">
        For example, it is unclear whether the author intended the following to be an {{h1}} heading
        or an {{h2}} heading:

        <pre class="bad" highlight="html">&lt;h2>Contact details&lt;/h2></pre>
      </div>

  : Cases that are likely to be typos
  :: When a user makes a simple typo, it is helpful if the error can be caught early, as this can
      save the author a lot of debugging time. This specification therefore usually considers it
      an error to use element names, attribute names, and so forth, that do not match the names
      defined in this specification.

      <p class="example">
        For example, if the author typed <code>&lt;capton></code> instead of
        <code>&lt;caption></code>, this would be flagged as an error and the author could correct
        the typo immediately.
      </p>

  : Errors that could interfere with new syntax in the future
  :: In order to allow the language syntax to be extended in the future, certain otherwise
      harmless features are disallowed.

      <p class="example">
        For example, "attributes" in end tags are ignored currently, but they are invalid, in case a
        future change to the language makes use of that syntax feature without conflicting with
        already-deployed (and valid!) content.
      </p>

  Some authors find it helpful to be in the practice of always quoting all attributes and always
  including all optional tags, preferring the consistency derived from such custom over the minor
  benefits of terseness afforded by making use of the flexibility of the HTML syntax. To aid such
  authors, conformance checkers can provide modes of operation wherein such conventions are
  enforced.

<h4 id="restrictions-on-content-models-and-on-attribute-values">Restrictions on content models and
on attribute values</h4>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  Beyond the syntax of the language, this specification also places restrictions on how elements
  and attributes can be specified. These restrictions are present for similar reasons:

  : Errors involving content with dubious semantics
  :: To avoid misuse of elements with defined meanings, content models are defined that restrict
      how elements can be nested when such nestings would be of dubious value.

      <p class="example">
        For example, this specification disallows nesting a <{section}> element inside
        a <{kbd}> element, since it is highly unlikely for an author to indicate that
        an entire section should be keyed in.
      </p>

  : Errors that involve a conflict in expressed semantics
  :: Similarly, to draw the author's attention to mistakes in the use of elements, clear
      contradictions in the semantics expressed are also considered conformance errors.

      <div class="example">
        In the fragments below, for example, the semantics are nonsensical: a separator cannot
        simultaneously be a cell, nor can a radio button be a progress bar.

        <pre class="bad" highlight="html">&lt;hr role="cell"></pre>
        <pre class="bad" highlight="html">&lt;input type=radio role=progressbar></pre>
      </div>

      <p class="example">
        Another example is the restrictions on the content models of the <{ul}> element, which only
        allows <{li}> element children. Lists by definition consist just of zero or more list items,
        so if a <{ul}> element contains something other than an <{li}> element, it's not clear what
        was meant.
      </p>

  : Cases where the default styles are likely to lead to confusion
  :: Certain elements have default styles or behaviors that make certain combinations likely to
      lead to confusion. Where these have equivalent alternatives without this problem, the
      confusing combinations are disallowed.

      <p class="example">
        For example, <{div}> elements are rendered as block boxes, and <{span}> elements as inline
        boxes. Putting a block box in an inline box is unnecessarily confusing; since either nesting
        just <{div}> elements, or nesting just <{span}> elements, or nesting <{span}> elements
        inside <{div}> elements all serve the same purpose as nesting a <{div}> element in a
        <{span}> element, but only the latter involves a block box in an inline box, the latter
        combination is disallowed.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Another example would be the way <a>interactive content</a> cannot be nested. For example, a
        <{button}> element cannot contain a <{textarea}> element. This is because the default
        behavior of such nesting interactive elements would be highly confusing to users. Instead of
        nesting these elements, they can be placed side by side.
      </p>

  : Errors that indicate a likely misunderstanding of the specification
  :: Sometimes, something is disallowed because allowing it would likely cause author confusion.

      <p class="example">
        For example, setting the <code>disabled</code> attribute to the value "<code>false</code>"
        is disallowed, because despite the appearance of meaning that the element is enabled, it in
        fact means that the element is <em>disabled</em> (what matters for implementations is the
        presence of the attribute, not its value).
      </p>

  : Errors involving limits that have been imposed merely to simplify the language
  :: Some conformance errors simplify the language that authors need to learn.

      <p class="example">
        For example, the <{area}> element's <{area/shape}> attribute, despite accepting both
        <code>circ</code> and <code>circle</code> values in practice as synonyms, disallows the use
        of the <code>circ</code> value, so as to simplify tutorials and other learning aids. There
        would be no benefit to allowing both, but it would cause extra confusion when teaching the
        language.
      </p>

  : Errors that involve peculiarities of the parser
  :: Certain elements are parsed in somewhat eccentric ways (typically for historical reasons),
      and their content model restrictions are intended to avoid exposing the author to these
      issues.

      <div class="example">
        For example, a <{form}> element isn't allowed inside <a>phrasing content</a>, because when
        parsed as HTML, a <{form}> element's start tag will imply a <{p}> element's end tag. Thus,
        the following markup results in two paragraphs, not one:

        <pre highlight="html">&lt;p>Welcome. &lt;form>&lt;label>Name:&lt;/label> &lt;input>&lt;/form></pre>

        It is parsed exactly like the following:

        <pre highlight="html">&lt;p>Welcome. &lt;/p>&lt;form>&lt;label>Name:&lt;/label> &lt;input>&lt;/form></pre>
      </div>

  : Errors that would likely result in scripts failing in hard-to-debug ways
  :: Some errors are intended to help prevent script problems that would be hard to debug.

      <p class="example">
        This is why, for instance, it is non-conforming to have two <code>id</code> attributes with
        the same value. Duplicate IDs lead to the wrong element being selected, with sometimes
        disastrous effects whose cause is hard to determine.
      </p>

  : Errors that waste authoring time
  :: Some constructs are disallowed because historically they have been the cause of a lot of
      wasted authoring time, and by encouraging authors to avoid making them, authors can save time
      in future efforts.

      <p class="example">
        For example, a <{script> element's <{script/src}> attribute causes the element's contents to
        be ignored. However, this isn't obvious, especially if the element's contents appear to be
        executable script &mdash; which can lead to authors spending a lot of time trying to debug
        the inline script without realizing that it is not executing. To reduce this problem, this
        specification makes it non-conforming to have executable script in a <{script}> element when
        the <{script/src}> attribute is present. This means that authors who are validating their
        documents are less likely to waste time with this kind of mistake.
      </p>

  : Errors that involve areas that affect authors migrating to and from XHTML
  :: Some authors like to write files that can be interpreted as both XML and HTML with similar
      results. Though this practice is discouraged in general due to the myriad of subtle
      complications involved (especially when involving scripting, styling, or any kind of automated
      serialization), this specification has a few restrictions intended to at least somewhat
      mitigate the difficulties. This makes it easier for authors to use this as a transitionary
      step when migrating between HTML and XHTML.

      <p class="example">
        For example, there are somewhat complicated rules surrounding the <code>lang</code> and
        <code>xml:lang</code> attributes intended to keep the two synchronized.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        Another example would be the restrictions on the values of <code>xmlns</code> attributes
        in the HTML serialization, which are intended to ensure that elements in conforming
        documents end up in the same namespaces whether processed as HTML or XML.
      </p>

  : Errors that involve areas reserved for future expansion
  :: As with the restrictions on the syntax intended to allow for new syntax in future revisions
      of the language, some restrictions on the content models of elements and values of attributes
      are intended to allow for future expansion of the HTML vocabulary.

      <p class="example">
        For example, limiting the values of the <code>target</code> attribute that start with an
        U+005F LOW LINE character (_) to only specific predefined values allows new predefined
        values to be introduced at a future time without conflicting with author-defined values.
      </p>

  : Errors that indicate a mis-use of other specifications
  :: Certain restrictions are intended to support the restrictions made by other specifications.

      <p class="example">
        For example, requiring that attributes that take media query lists use only <em>valid</em>
        media query lists reinforces the importance of following the conformance rules of that
        specification.

<h2 id="infrastructure">Common infrastructure</h2>

  <h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>

  This specification refers to both HTML and XML attributes and IDL attributes, often in the same
  context. When it is not clear which is being referred to, they are referred to as
  <dfn>content attributes</dfn> for HTML and XML attributes, and <dfn>IDL attributes</dfn> for those
  defined on IDL interfaces. Similarly, the term "properties" is used for both JavaScript object
  properties and CSS properties. When these are ambiguous they are qualified as
  <dfn>object properties</dfn> and <dfn>CSS properties</dfn> respectively.

  Generally, when the specification states that a feature applies to <a>the HTML syntax</a> or
  <a>the XHTML syntax</a>, it also includes the other. When a feature specifically only applies to
  one of the two languages, it is called out by explicitly stating that it does not apply to the
  other format, as in "for HTML, ... (this does not apply to XHTML)".

  This specification uses the term <dfn>document</dfn> to refer to any use of HTML, ranging from
  short static documents to long essays or reports with rich multimedia, as well as to fully-fledged
  interactive applications. The term is used to refer both to <{Document}> objects and
  their descendant DOM trees, and to serialized byte streams using the <a>HTML syntax</a> or
  <a>XHTML syntax</a>, depending on context.

  In the context of the DOM structures, the terms <a>HTML document</a> and <a>XML document</a> are
  used as defined in the DOM specification, and refer specifically to two different modes that
  <{Document}> objects can find themselves in. [[!DOM]] (Such uses are always hyperlinked
  to their definition.)

  In the context of byte streams, the term HTML document refers to resources labeled as
  <code>text/html</code>, and the term XML document refers to resources labeled with an
  <a>XML MIME type</a>.

  The term <dfn>XHTML document</dfn> is used to refer to both <{Document}>s in the
  <a>XML document</a> mode that contains element nodes in the <a>HTML namespace</a>, and byte
  streams labeled with an <a>XML MIME type</a> that contain elements from the <a>HTML namespace</a>,
  depending on context.

  <hr />

  For simplicity, terms such as <dfn>shown</dfn>, <dfn>displayed</dfn>, and <dfn>visible</dfn> might
  sometimes be used when referring to the way a document is rendered to the user. These terms are
  not meant to imply a visual medium; they must be considered to apply to other media in equivalent
  ways.

  <div class="impl">
    When an algorithm B says to return to another algorithm A, it implies that A called B. Upon
    returning to A, the implementation must continue from where it left off in calling B. Some
    algorithms run <dfn>in parallel</dfn>; this means that the algorithm's subsequent steps are to
    be run, one after another, at the same time as other logic in the specification (e.g. at the
    same time as the <a>event loop</a>). This specification does not define the precise mechanism by
    which this is achieved, be it time-sharing cooperative multitasking, fibers, threads, processes,
    using different hyperthreads, cores, CPUs, machines, etc. By contrast, an operation that is to
    run <dfn>immediately</dfn> must interrupt the currently running task, run itself, and then
    resume the previously running task.
  </div>

  The term "transparent black" refers to the color with red, green, blue, and alpha channels all set
  to zero.

<h4 id="resources">Resources</h4>

  The specification uses the term <dfn>supported</dfn> when referring to whether a user agent has an
  implementation capable of decoding the semantics of an external resource. A format or type is said
  to be <i>supported</i> if the implementation can process an external resource of that format or
  type without critical aspects of the resource being ignored. Whether a specific resource is
  <i>supported</i> can depend on what features of the resource's format are in use.

  <p class="example">
    For example, a PNG image would be considered to be in a supported format if its pixel data could
    be decoded and rendered, even if, unbeknownst to the implementation, the image also contained
    animation data.
  </p>

  <p class="example">
    An MPEG-4 video file would not be considered to be in a supported format if the compression
    format used was not supported, even if the implementation could determine the dimensions of the
    movie from the file's metadata.
  </p>

  What some specifications, in particular the HTTP specification, refer to as a
  <i>representation</i> is referred to in this specification as a <dfn>resource</dfn>. [[!HTTP11]]

  The term <dfn>MIME type</dfn> is used to refer to what is sometimes called an <i>Internet media
  type</i> in protocol literature. The term <i>media type</i> in this specification is used to refer
  to the type of media intended for presentation, as used by the CSS specifications. [[!RFC2046]]
  [[!MEDIAQ]]

  A string is a <dfn>valid MIME type</dfn> if it matches the <code>media-type</code> rule defined in
  section 3.7 "Media Types" of RFC 2616. In particular, a <a>valid MIME type</a> may include
  MIME type parameters. [[!HTTP11]]

  A string is a <dfn>valid MIME type with no parameters</dfn> if it matches the
  <code>media-type</code> rule defined in section 3.7 "Media Types" of RFC 2616, but does not
  contain any U+003B SEMICOLON characters (;). In other words, if it consists only of a type and
  subtype, with no MIME Type parameters. [[!HTTP11]]

  The term <dfn>HTML MIME type</dfn> is used to refer to the <a>MIME type</a>
  <code>text/html</code>.

  A resource's <dfn>critical subresources</dfn> are those that the resource needs to have available
  to be correctly processed. Which resources are considered critical or not is defined by the
  specification that defines the resource's format.

  The term <dfn><code>data:</code> URL</dfn> refers to <a>URLs</a> that use the <code>data:</code>
  scheme. [[!RFC2397]]

<h4 id="xml">XML</h4>

  To ease migration from HTML to XHTML, UAs conforming to this specification will place elements in
  HTML in the <code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code> namespace, at least for the purposes of the
  DOM and CSS. The term "<dfn>HTML elements</dfn>", when used in this specification, refers to any
  element in that namespace, and thus refers to both HTML and XHTML elements.

  Except where otherwise stated, all elements defined or mentioned in this specification are in the
  <a>HTML namespace</a> ("<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>"), and all attributes defined or
  mentioned in this specification have no namespace.

  The term <dfn>element type</dfn> is used to refer to the set of elements that have a given local
  name and namespace. For example, <code>button</code> elements are elements with the element type
  <code>button</code>, meaning they have the local name "<code>button</code>" and (implicitly as
  defined above) the <a>HTML namespace</a>.

  Attribute names are said to be <dfn>XML-compatible</dfn> if they match the
  <a><code>Name</code></a> production defined in XML and they contain no U+003A COLON characters
  (:). [[!XML]]

  The term <dfn>XML MIME type</dfn> is used to refer to the <a>MIME types</a> <code>text/xml</code>,
  <code>application/xml</code>, and any <a>MIME type</a> whose subtype ends with the four characters
  "<code>+xml</code>". [[!RFC7303]]

<h4 id="dom-trees">DOM trees</h4>

  The <dfn>root element of a <{Document}> object</dfn> is that <{Document}>'s
  first element child, if any. If it does not have one then the <{Document}> has no root
  element.

  The term <dfn>root element</dfn>, when not referring to a <{Document}> object's root
  element, means the furthest ancestor element node of whatever node is being discussed, or the node
  itself if it has no ancestors. When the node is a part of the document, then the node's
  <a>root element</a> is indeed the document's root element; however, if the node is not currently
  part of the document tree, the root element will be an orphaned node.

  When an element's <a>root element</a> is the <a>root element of a <code>Document</code> object</a>,
  it is said to be <dfn>in a <{Document}></dfn>. An element is said to have been
  <dfn>inserted into a document</dfn> when its <a>root element</a> changes and is now the document's
  <a>root element</a>. Analogously, an element is said to have been
  <dfn>removed from a document</dfn> when its <a>root element</a> changes from being the document's
  <a>root element</a> to being another element.

  A node's <dfn>home subtree</dfn> is the subtree rooted at that node's <a>root element</a>. When a
  node is <span>in a <{Document}></span>, its <a>home subtree</a> is that <{Document}>'s tree.

  The <{Document}> of a <code>Node</code> (such as an element) is the <{Document}>
  that the <code>Node</code>'s <code>ownerDocument</code> IDL attribute returns. When a
  <code>Node</code> is <span>in a <{Document}></span> then that <{Document}> is
  always the <code>Node</code>'s <{Document}>, and the <code>Node</code>'s
  <code>ownerDocument</code> IDL attribute thus always returns that <{Document}>.

  The <{Document}> of a content attribute is the <{Document}> of the attribute's
  element.

  The term <dfn>tree order</dfn> means a pre-order, depth-first traversal of DOM nodes involved
  (through the <code>parentNode</code>/<code>childNodes</code> relationship).

  When it is stated that some element or attribute is <dfn>ignored</dfn>, or treated as some other
  value, or handled as if it was something else, this refers only to the processing of the node
  after it is in the DOM. <span class="impl">A user agent must not mutate the DOM in such
  situations.</span>

  A content attribute is said to <dfn>change</dfn> value only if its new value is different than its
  previous value; setting an attribute to a value it already has does not change it.

  The term <dfn>empty</dfn>, when used of an attribute value, <code>Text</code> node, or string,
  means that the length of the text is zero (i.e. not even containing spaces or
  <a>control characters</a>).

  A <dfn>node <var>A</var> is inserted</dfn> into a node <var>B</var> when the
  <a>insertion steps</a> are invoked with <var>A</var> as the argument and <var>A</var>'s new parent
  is <var>B</var>. Similarly, a <dfn>node <var>A</var> is removed</dfn> from a node <var>B</var>
  when the <a>removing steps</a> are invoked with <var>A</var> as the <var>removedNode</var>
  argument and <var>B</var> as the <var>oldParent</var> argument.

<h4 id="scripting">Scripting</h4>

  The construction "a <code>Foo</code> object", where <code>Foo</code> is actually an interface,
  is sometimes used instead of the more accurate "an object implementing the interface
  <code>Foo</code>".

  An IDL attribute is said to be <dfn>getting</dfn> when its value is being retrieved
  (e.g. by author script), and is said to be <dfn>setting</dfn> when a new value is
  assigned to it.

  If a DOM object is said to be <dfn>live</dfn>, then the attributes and methods on that object
  <span class="impl">must</span> operate on the actual underlying data, not a snapshot of the
  data.

  In the contexts of events, the terms <i>fire</i> and <i>dispatch</i> are used as defined in the
  DOM specification: <dfn>firing</dfn> an event means to create and <a>dispatch</a> it, and
  <dfn>dispatching</dfn> an event means to follow the steps that propagate the event through the
  tree. The term <dfn>trusted event</dfn> is used to refer to events whose <code>isTrusted</code>
  attribute is initialized to true. [[!DOM]]

<h4 id="plugins">Plugins</h4>

  The term <dfn>plugin</dfn> refers to a user-agent defined set of content handlers used by the user
  agent that can take part in the user agent's rendering of a <{Document}> object, but that
  neither act as <a>child browsing contexts</a> of the <{Document}> nor introduce any
  <code>Node</code> objects to the <{Document}>'s DOM.

  Typically such content handlers are provided by third parties, though a user agent can also
  designate built-in content handlers as plugins.

  <div class="impl">
    A user agent must not consider the types <code>text/plain</code> and
    <code>application/octet-stream</code> as having a registered <a>plugin</a>.
  </div>

  <p class="example">
    One example of a plugin would be a PDF viewer that is instantiated in a
    <a>browsing context</a> when the user navigates to a PDF file. This would count as a
    plugin regardless of whether the party that implemented the PDF viewer component was the same as
    that which implemented the user agent itself. However, a PDF viewer application that launches
    separate from the user agent (as opposed to using the same interface) is not a plugin by this
    definition.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    This specification does not define a mechanism for interacting with plugins, as it is expected
    to be user-agent- and platform-specific. Some UAs might opt to support a plugin mechanism such
    as the Netscape Plugin API; others might use remote content converters or have built-in support
    for certain types. Indeed, this specification doesn't require user agents to support plugins at
    all. [[!NPAPI]]
  </p>

  A plugin can be <dfn>secured</dfn> if it honors the semantics of the <code>sandbox</code>
  attribute.

  <p class="example">
    For example, a secured plugin would prevent its contents from creating pop-up windows when the
    plugin is instantiated inside a sandboxed <code>iframe</code>.
  </p>

  <div class="impl">
    <p class="warning">
      Browsers should take extreme care when interacting with external content intended for
      <a>plugins</a>. When third-party software is run with the same privileges as the user agent
      itself, vulnerabilities in the third-party software become as dangerous as those in the user
      agent.
    </p>

    Since different users having differents sets of <a>plugins</a> provides a fingerprinting vector
    that increases the chances of users being uniquely identified, user agents are encouraged to
    support the exact same set of <a>plugins</a> for each user.

  </div>

<h4 id="encoding-terminology">Character encodings</h4>

  A <dfn>character encoding</dfn>, or just <i>encoding</i> where that is not ambiguous, is a defined
  way to convert between byte streams and Unicode strings, as defined in the Encoding standard. An
  <a>encoding</a> has an <dfn>encoding name</dfn> and one or more <dfn>encoding labels</dfn>,
  referred to as the encoding's <i>name</i> and <i>labels</i> in the Encoding standard.
  [[!ENCODING]]

  An <dfn>ASCII-compatible character encoding</dfn> is a single-byte or variable-length
  <a>encoding</a> in which the bytes 0x09, 0x0A, 0x0C, 0x0D, 0x20 - 0x22, 0x26, 0x27, 0x2C - 0x3F,
  0x41 - 0x5A, and 0x61 - 0x7A, ignoring bytes that are the second and later bytes of multibyte
  sequences, all correspond to single-byte sequences that map to the same Unicode characters as
  those bytes in Windows-1252. [[!ENCODING]]

  <p class="note">
    This includes such encodings as Shift_JIS, HZ-GB-2312, and variants of ISO-2022, even though it
    is possible in these encodings for bytes like 0x70 to be part of longer sequences that are
    unrelated to their interpretation as ASCII. It excludes UTF-16 variants, as well as obsolete
    legacy encodings such as UTF-7, GSM03.38, and EBCDIC variants.
  </p>

  The term <dfn>a UTF-16 encoding</dfn> refers to any variant of UTF-16: UTF-16LE or UTF-16BE,
  regardless of the presence or absence of a BOM. [[!ENCODING]]

  The term <dfn>code unit</dfn> is used as defined in the Web IDL specification: a 16 bit
  unsigned integer, the smallest atomic component of a <code>DOMString</code>. (This is a narrower
  definition than the one used in Unicode, and is not the same as a <i>code point</i>.) [[!WEBIDL]]

  The term <dfn>Unicode code point</dfn> means a <i>Unicode scalar value</i> where possible, and an
  isolated surrogate code point when not. When a conformance requirement is defined in terms of
  characters or Unicode code points, a pair of <a>code units</a> consisting of a high surrogate
  followed by a low surrogate must be treated as the single code point represented by the surrogate
  pair, but isolated surrogates must each be treated as the single code point with the value of the
  surrogate. [[!UNICODE]

  In this specification, the term <dfn>character</dfn>, when not qualified as <em>Unicode</em>
  character, is synonymous with the term <a>Unicode code point</a>.

  The term <dfn>Unicode character</dfn> is used to mean a <i>Unicode scalar value</i> (i.e. any
  Unicode code point that is not a surrogate code point). [[!UNICODE]]

  The <dfn>code-unit length</dfn> of a string is the number of <a>code units</a> in that string.

  <p class="note">
    This complexity results from the historical decision to define the DOM API in terms of 16 bit
    (UTF-16) <a>code units</a>, rather than in terms of <a>Unicode characters</a>.
  </p>

<h3 id="conformance-requirements">Conformance requirements</h3>

  All diagrams, examples, and notes in this specification are non-normative, as are all sections
  explicitly marked non-normative. Everything else in this specification is normative.

  The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", <!--"REQUIRED",--> <!--"SHALL", "SHALL NOT",--> "SHOULD", "SHOULD
  NOT", <!--"RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED",--> "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in the normative parts of
  this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119. The key word "OPTIONALLY" in the
  normative parts of this document is to be interpreted with the same normative meaning as "MAY" and
  "OPTIONAL". For readability, these words do not appear in all uppercase letters in this
  specification. [[!RFC2119]]

  <div class="impl">
    Requirements phrased in the imperative as part of algorithms (such as "strip any leading space
    characters" or "return false and abort these steps") are to be interpreted with the meaning of
    the key word ("must", "should", "may", etc) used in introducing the algorithm.

    <div class="example">
      For example, were the spec to say:

      <pre>
        To eat an orange, the user must:
        1. Peel the orange.
        2. Separate each slice of the orange.
        3. Eat the orange slices.
      </pre>

      ...it would be equivalent to the following:

      <pre>
        To eat an orange:
        1. The user must peel the orange.
        2. The user must separate each slice of the orange.
        3. The user must eat the orange slices.
      </pre>

      Here the key word is "must".

      The former (imperative) style is generally preferred in this specification for stylistic
      reasons.
    </div>

    Conformance requirements phrased as algorithms or specific steps may be implemented in any
    manner, so long as the end result is equivalent. (In particular, the algorithms defined in this
    specification are intended to be easy to follow, and not intended to be performant.)
  </div>

<div class="impl">
  <h4 id="conformance-classes">Conformance classes</h4>

  This specification describes the conformance criteria for <span class="impl">user agents (relevant
  to implementors) and</span> documents<span class="impl"> (relevant to authors and authoring tool
  implementors)</span>.

  <dfn>Conforming documents</dfn> are those that comply with all the conformance criteria for
  documents. For readability, some of these conformance requirements are phrased as conformance
  requirements on authors; such requirements are implicitly requirements on documents: by
  definition, all documents are assumed to have had an author. (In some cases, that author may
  itself be a user agent &mdash; such user agents are subject to additional rules, as explained
  below.)

  <p class="example">
    For example, if a requirement states that "authors must not use the <code>foobar</code>
    element", it would imply that documents are not allowed to contain elements named
    <code>foobar</code>.
  </p>

  <p class="note impl">
    There is no implied relationship between document conformance requirements and implementation
    conformance requirements. User agents are not free to handle non-conformant documents as they
    please; the processing model described in this specification applies to implementations
    regardless of the conformity of the input documents.
  </p>

  User agents fall into several (overlapping) categories with different conformance requirements.

  : Web browsers and other interactive user agents
  :: Web browsers that support <a>the XHTML syntax</a> must process elements and attributes from the
      <a>HTML namespace</a> found in XML documents as described in this specification, so that users
      can interact with them, unless the semantics of those elements have been overridden by other
      specifications.

      <p class="example">
        A conforming XHTML processor would, upon finding an XHTML <code>script</code> element in an
        XML document, execute the script contained in that element. However, if the element is found
        within a transformation expressed in XSLT (assuming the user agent also supports XSLT), then
        the processor would instead treat the <code>script</code> element as an opaque element that
        forms part of the transform.
      </p>

      Web browsers that support <a>the HTML syntax</a> must process documents labeled with an
      <a>HTML MIME type</a> as described in this specification, so that users can interact with
      them.

      User agents that support scripting must also be conforming implementations of the IDL
      fragments in this specification, as described in the Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]

      <p class="note">
        Unless explicitly stated, specifications that override the semantics of HTML elements do not
        override the requirements on DOM objects representing those elements. For example, the
        <code>script</code> element in the example above would still implement the
        <code>HTMLScriptElement</code> interface.
      </p>

  : Non-interactive presentation user agents
  :: User agents that process HTML and XHTML documents purely to render non-interactive versions
      of them must comply to the same conformance criteria as Web browsers, except that they are
      exempt from requirements regarding user interaction.

      <p class="note">
        Typical examples of non-interactive presentation user agents are printers (static UAs) and
        overhead displays (dynamic UAs). It is expected that most static non-interactive
        presentation user agents will also opt to <a>lack scripting support</a>.
      </p>

      <p class="example">
        A non-interactive but dynamic presentation UA would still execute scripts, allowing forms
        to be dynamically submitted, and so forth. However, since the concept of "focus" is
        irrelevant when the user cannot interact with the document, the UA would not need to support
        any of the focus-related DOM APIs.
      </p>

  : Visual user agents that support the suggested default rendering
  :: User agents, whether interactive or not, may be designated (possibly as a user option) as
      supporting the suggested default rendering defined by this specification.

      This is not required. In particular, even user agents that do implement the suggested default
      rendering are encouraged to offer settings that override this default to improve the
      experience for the user, e.g. changing the color contrast, using different focus styles, or
      otherwise making the experience more accessible and usable to the user.

      User agents that are designated as supporting the suggested default rendering must, while so
      designated, implement the rules in <aa>the rendering section</a> that that section defines as
      the behavior that user agents are <em>expected</em> to implement.

    : User agents with no scripting support

    :: Implementations that do not support scripting (or which have their scripting features
        disabled entirely) are exempt from supporting the events and DOM interfaces mentioned in
        this specification. For the parts of this specification that are defined in terms of an
        events model or in terms of the DOM, such user agents must still act as if events and the
        DOM were supported.

        <p class="note">
          Scripting can form an integral part of an application. Web browsers that do not support
          scripting, or that have scripting disabled, might be unable to fully convey the author's
          intent.
        </p>

  : Conformance checkers
  :: Conformance checkers must verify that a document conforms to the applicable conformance
      criteria described in this specification. Automated conformance checkers are exempt from
      detecting errors that require interpretation of the author's intent (for example, while a
      document is non-conforming if the content of a <code>blockquote</code> element is not a quote,
      conformance checkers running without the input of human judgement do not have to check that
      <code>blockquote</code> elements only contain quoted material).

      Conformance checkers must check that the input document conforms when parsed without a
      <a>browsing context</a> (meaning that no scripts are run, and that the parser's
      <a>scripting flag</a> is disabled), and should also check that the input document conforms
      when parsed with a <a>browsing context</a> in which scripts execute, and that the scripts
      never cause non-conforming states to occur other than transiently during script execution
      itself. (This is only a "SHOULD" and not a "MUST" requirement because it has been proven to be
      impossible. [[COMPUTABLE]])

      The term "HTML validator" can be used to refer to a conformance checker that itself conforms
      to the applicable requirements of this specification.

      <div class="note">
        XML DTDs cannot express all the conformance requirements of this specification. Therefore, a
        validating XML processor and a DTD cannot constitute a conformance checker. Also, since
        neither of the two authoring formats defined in this specification are applications of SGML,
        a validating SGML system cannot constitute a conformance checker either.

        To put it another way, there are three types of conformance criteria:

        1. Criteria that can be expressed in a DTD.
        2. Criteria that cannot be expressed by a DTD, but can still be checked by a machine.
        3. Criteria that can only be checked by a human.

        A conformance checker must check for the first two. A simple DTD-based validator only checks
        for the first class of errors and is therefore not a conforming conformance checker
        according to this specification.
      </div>

  : Data mining tools
  :: Applications and tools that process HTML and XHTML documents for reasons other than to either
      render the documents or check them for conformance should act in accordance with the semantics
      of the documents that they process.

      <p class="example">
        A tool that generates <a>document outlines</a> but increases the nesting level for each
        paragraph and does not increase the nesting level for each section would not be conforming.
      </p>

  : Authoring tools and markup generators
  :: Authoring tools and markup generators must generate <a>conforming documents</a>. Conformance
      criteria that apply to authors also apply to authoring tools, where appropriate.

      Authoring tools are exempt from the strict requirements of using elements only for their
      specified purpose, but only to the extent that authoring tools are not yet able to determine
      author intent. However, authoring tools must not automatically misuse elements or encourage
      their users to do so.

      <p class="example">
        For example, it is not conforming to use an <code>address</code> element for arbitrary
        contact information; that element can only be used for marking up contact information for
        the author of the document or section. However, since an authoring tool is likely unable to
        determine the difference, an authoring tool is exempt from that requirement. This does not
        mean, though, that authoring tools can use <code>address</code> elements for any block of
        italics text (for instance); it just means that the authoring tool doesn't have to verify
        that when the user uses a tool for inserting contact information for a section, that the
        user really is doing that and not inserting something else instead.
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        In terms of conformance checking, an editor has to output documents that conform to the same
        extent that a conformance checker will verify.
      </p>

      When an authoring tool is used to edit a non-conforming document, it may preserve the
      conformance errors in sections of the document that were not edited during the editing session
      (i.e. an editing tool is allowed to round-trip erroneous content). However, an authoring tool
      must not claim that the output is conformant if errors have been so preserved.

      Authoring tools are expected to come in two broad varieties: tools that work from structure
      or semantic data, and tools that work on a What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get media-specific editing
      basis (WYSIWYG).

      The former is the preferred mechanism for tools that author HTML, since the structure in the
      source information can be used to make informed choices regarding which HTML elements and
      attributes are most appropriate.

      However, WYSIWYG tools are legitimate. WYSIWYG tools should use elements they know are
      appropriate, and should not use elements that they do not know to be appropriate. This might
      in certain extreme cases mean limiting the use of flow elements to just a few elements, like
      <{div}>, <{b}>, <{i}>, and <{span}> and making liberal use of the <code>style</code>
      attribute.

      All authoring tools, whether WYSIWYG or not, should make a best effort attempt at enabling
      users to create well-structured, semantically rich, media-independent content.

  User agents may impose implementation-specific limits on otherwise unconstrained inputs, e.g. to
  prevent denial of service attacks, to guard against running out of memory, or to work around
  platform-specific limitations.
  <a class="fingerprint" href="#fingerprinting-vector"><img height="21" src="images/fingerprint.png" width="15" alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" /></a>

  For compatibility with existing content and prior specifications, this specification describes
  two authoring formats: one based on XML (referred to as <a>the XHTML syntax</a>), and one using a
  <a>custom format</a> inspired by SGML (referred to as <a>the HTML syntax</a>). Implementations
  must support at least one of these two formats, although supporting both is encouraged.

  Some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on elements, attributes, methods or
  objects. Such requirements fall into two categories: those describing content model restrictions,
  and those describing implementation behavior. Those in the former category are requirements on
  documents and authoring tools. Those in the second category are requirements on user agents.
  Similarly, some conformance requirements are phrased as requirements on authors; such requirements
  are to be interpreted as conformance requirements on the documents that authors produce. (In other
  words, this specification does not distinguish between conformance criteria on authors and
  conformance criteria on documents.)

  <h4 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h4>

  This specification relies on several other underlying specifications.

  : Unicode and Encoding
  :: The Unicode character set is used to represent textual data, and the Encoding standard defines
      requirements around <a>character encodings</a>. [[!UNICODE]]

      <p class="note">
        This specification <a>introduces terminology</a> based on the terms defined in those
        specifications, as described earlier.
      </p>

      The following terms are used as defined in the Encoding standard: [[!ENCODING]]

      * <dfn>Getting an encoding</dfn>

      * The <dfn>encoder</dfn> and <dfn>decoder</dfn> algorithms for various encodings, including
        the <dfn>UTF-8 encoder</dfn> and <dfn>UTF-8 decoder</dfn>

      * The generic <dfn>decode</dfn> algorithm which takes a byte stream and an encoding and
        returns a character stream

      * The <dfn>UTF-8 decode</dfn> algorithm which takes a byte stream and returns a character
        stream, additionally stripping one leading UTF-8 Byte Order Mark (BOM), if any

      <p class="note">
        The <a>UTF-8 decoder</a> is distinct from the <i>UTF-8 decode algorithm</i>. The latter
        first strips a Byte Order Mark (BOM), if any, and then invokes the former.
      </p>

      For readability, character encodings are sometimes referenced in this specification with a
      case that differs from the canonical case given in the Encoding standard. (For example,
      "UTF-16LE" instead of "utf-16le".)</p>

  : XML and related specifications

  : Web IDL
  :: The IDL fragments in this specification must be interpreted as required for conforming IDL
      fragments, as described in the Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]

      The following terms are defined in the Web IDL specification:

      * <dfn>Supported property indices</dfn>
      * <dfn>Determine the value of an indexed property</dfn>

      * <dfn>Callback this value</dfn>
      * <dfn>Converting</dfn> between WebIDL types and JS types
      * <dfn>invoke the Web IDL callback function</dfn>

      The Web IDL specification also defines the following types that are used in Web IDL fragments
      in this specification:

      * <dfn><code>Array</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>boolean</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>Boolean</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>DOMString</code></dfn>

      * <dfn><code>String</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>unrestricted double</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>unsigned long</code></dfn>

      The term <dfn>throw</dfn> in this specification is used as defined in the WebIDL
      specification. The following exception names are defined by WebIDL and used by this
      specification:

      * <dfn><code>IndexSizeError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>HierarchyRequestError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>InvalidCharacterError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>NotFoundError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>NotSupportedError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>InvalidStateError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>SyntaxError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>InvalidAccessError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>SecurityError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>NetworkError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>QuotaExceededError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>TimeoutError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>DataCloneError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>TypeError</code></dfn>

      When this specification requires a user agent to <dfn>create a <code>Date</code> object</dfn>
      representing a particular time (which could be the special value Not-a-Number), the
      milliseconds component of that time, if any, must be truncated to an integer, and the time
      value of the newly created <code>Date</code> object must represent the resulting truncated
      time.

      <p class="example">
        For instance, given the time 23045 millionths of a second after 01:00 UTC on January 1st
        2000, i.e. the time 2000-01-01T00:00:00.023045Z, then the <code>Date</code> object created
        representing that time would represent the same time as that created representing the time
        2000-01-01T00:00:00.023Z, 45 millionths earlier. If the given time is NaN, then the result
        is a <code>Date</code> object that represents a time value NaN (indicating that the object
        does not represent a specific instant of time).
      </p>

  : JavaScript
  :: Some parts of the language described by this specification only support JavaScript as the
      underlying scripting language. [[!ECMA-262]]

      <p class="note">
        The term "JavaScript" is used to refer to ECMA262, rather than the official term ECMAScript,
        since the term JavaScript is more widely known. Similarly, the <a>MIME type</a> used to
        refer to JavaScript in this specification is <code>text/javascript</code>, since that is the
        most commonly used type, <a>despite it being an officially obsoleted type</a> according to
        RFC 4329. [[!RFC4329]]
      </p>

      The term <dfn>JavaScript global environment</dfn> refers to the <i>global environment</i>
      concept defined in the ECMAScript specification.

      The ECMAScript <dfn><code>SyntaxError</code></dfn> exception is also defined in the ECMAScript
      specification. [[!ECMA-262]]

      The <dfn>ArrayBuffer</dfn> and related object types and underlying concepts from the
      ECMAScript Specification are used for several features in this specification. [[!ECMA-262]]

      The <dfn><code>Date</code></dfn> object type from the ECMAScript Specification is used for
      several features of this specification. [[!ECMA-262]]

      The following helper IDL is used for referring to <code>ArrayBuffer</code>-related types:

      <pre class="idl-ignore" highlight="webidl">
        typedef (Int8Array or Uint8Array or Uint8ClampedArray or Int16Array or Uint16Array or Int32Array or Uint32Array or Float32Array or Float64Array or DataView) ArrayBufferView;
      </pre>

      <p class="note">
        In particular, the <code>Uint8ClampedArray</code> type is used by some
        <a>2D canvas APIs</a>, and the <a><code>WebSocket</code> API</a> uses
        <code>ArrayBuffer</code> objects for handling binary frames.
      </p>

  : DOM
  :: The Document Object Model (DOM) is a representation &mdash; a model &mdash; of a document and
      its content. The DOM is not just an API; the conformance criteria of HTML implementations are
      defined, in this specification, in terms of operations on the DOM. [[!DOM]]

      Implementations must support DOM and the events defined in UI Events, because this
      specification is defined in terms of the DOM, and some of the features are defined as
      extensions to the DOM interfaces. [[!DOM]] [[!UIEVENTS]]

      In particular, the following features are defined in the DOM specification: [[!DOM]]

      * <dfn><code>MutationObserver</code></dfn> interface and <dfn>mutation observers</dfn> in
        general

      The term <dfn>throw</dfn> in this specification is used as defined in the DOM specification.
      The following <code>DOMException</code> types are defined in the DOM specification: [[!DOM]]

      * <dfn><code>IndexSizeError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>HierarchyRequestError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>WrongDocumentError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>InvalidCharacterError</code></dfn>

      * <dfn><code>SyntaxError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>InvalidModificationError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>NamespaceError</code></dfn>

      * <dfn><code>TimeoutError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>InvalidNodeTypeError</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>DataCloneError</code></dfn>

      <p class="example">
        For example, to <i>throw a <code>TimeoutError</code> exception</i>, a user agent would
        construct a <code>DOMException</code> object whose type was the string
        "<code>TimeoutError</code>" (and whose code was the number 23, for legacy reasons) and
        actually throw that object as an exception.
      </p>

      The following features are defined in the UI Events specification: [[!UIEVENTS]]

      * <dfn><code>MouseEvent</code></dfn> interface
      * <dfn><code>MouseEventInit</code></dfn> dictionary type
      * The <dfn><code>FocusEvent</code></dfn> interface and its <dfn><code>relatedTarget</code></dfn> attribute

      The following features are defined in the Touch Events specification: [[!TOUCH-EVENTS]]

      * <dfn><code>Touch</code></dfn> interface
      * <dfn>Touch point</dfn> concept

      This specification sometimes uses the term <dfn>name</dfn> to refer to the event's
      <code>type</code>; as in, "an event named <code>click</code>" or "if the event name is
      <code>keypress</code>". The terms "name" and "type" for events are synonymous.

      The following features are defined in the DOM Parsing and Serialization specification:
      [[!DOMPARSING]]

      * <dfn><code>innerHTML</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>outerHTML</code></dfn>

      <p class="note">
        User agents are also encouraged to implement the features described in the
        <cite>HTML Editing APIs</cite> and <cite><code>UndoManager</code> and DOM Transaction</cite>
        specifications. [[!EDITING]] [[!UNDO]]
      </p>

      The following parts of the Fullscreen specification are referenced from this specification, in
      part to define the rendering of <code>dialog</code> elements, and also to define how the
      Fullscreen API interacts with the sandboxing features in HTML: [[!FULLSCREEN]]

      * The <dfn>top layer</dfn> concept
      * <dfn><code>requestFullscreen()</code></dfn>
      * The <dfn>fullscreen enabled flag</dfn>
      * The <dfn>fully exit fullscreen</dfn> algorithm

      The <cite>High Resolution Time</cite> specification provides the
      <dfn><code>DOMHighResTimeStamp</code></dfn> typedef and the
      <dfn><code>Performance</code></dfn> object's <dfn><code>now()</code></dfn> method.
      [[!HR-TIME-2]]

  : File API
  :: This specification uses the following features defined in the File API specification:
      [[!FILEAPI]]

      * <dfn><code>Blob</code></dfn> interface
      * <dfn><code>File</code></dfn> interface
      * <dfn><code>FileList</code></dfn> interface
      * <dfn><code>Blob.close()</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>Blob.type</code></dfn>
      * The concept of <dfn>read errors</dfn>

  : Media Providers
  :: This specification references the following interfaces:

      * <dfn><code>MediaStream</code></dfn> [[!MEDIASTREAM-RECORDING]]
      * <dfn><code>MediaSource</code></dfn> [[!MEDIA-SOURCE]]

  : XMLHttpRequest
  :: This specification references the XMLHttpRequest specification to describe how the two
      specifications interact and to use its <code>ProgressEvent</code> features. The following
      features and terms are defined in the XMLHttpRequest specification: [[!XHR]]

      * <dfn><code>XMLHttpRequest</code></dfn> interface
      * <dfn><code>XMLHttpRequest.responseXML</code></dfn> attribute
      * <dfn><code>ProgressEvent</code></dfn> interface
      * <dfn><code>ProgressEvent.lengthComputable</code></dfn> attribute
      * <dfn><code>ProgressEvent.loaded</code></dfn> attribute
      * <dfn><code>ProgressEvent.total</code></dfn> attribute
      * <dfn>Fire a progress event named <var>e</var></dfn>

  : Server-Sent Events
  :: This specification references <dfn><code>EventSource</code></dfn> which is specified in the
      Server-Sent Events specification [[!EVENTSOURCE]]

  : Media Queries
  :: Implementations must support the Media Queries language. [[!MEDIAQ]]

  : CSS modules
  :: While support for CSS as a whole is not required of implementations of this specification
      (though it is encouraged, at least for Web browsers), some features are defined in terms of
      specific CSS requirements.

      In particular, some features require that a string be
      <dfn>parsed as a CSS &lt;color&gt; value</dfn>. When parsing a CSS value, user agents are
      required by the CSS specifications to apply some error handling rules. These apply to this
      specification also. [[!CSS3COLOR]] [[!CSS-2015]]

      <p class="example">
        For example, user agents are required to close all open constructs upon finding the end of a
        style sheet unexpectedly. Thus, when parsing the string "<code>rgb(0,0,0</code>" (with a
        missing close-parenthesis) for a color value, the close parenthesis is implied by this error
        handling rule, and a value is obtained (the color 'black'). However, the similar construct
        "<code>rgb(0,0,</code>" (with both a missing parenthesis and a missing "blue" value) cannot
        be parsed, as closing the open construct does not result in a viable value.
      </p>

      The term <dfn>named color</dfn> is defined in the CSS Color specification. [[!CSS3COLOR]]

      The terms <dfn>replaced element</dfn> and <dfn>intrinsic dimensions</dfn> are defined in the
      CSS specification. [[!CSS-2015]]

      The terms <dfn>intrinsic width</dfn> and <dfn>intrinsic height</dfn> refer to the width
      dimension and the height dimension, respectively, of <a>intrinsic dimensions</a>.

      The term <dfn>provides a paint source</dfn> is used as defined in the
      <cite>CSS Image Values and Replaced Content</cite> specification to define the interaction of
      certain HTML elements with the CSS 'element()' function. [[!CSS3-IMAGES]]

      The term <dfn>default object size</dfn> is also defined in the
      <cite>CSS Image Values and Replaced Content</cite> specification. [[!CSS3-IMAGES]]

      Implementations that support scripting must support the CSS Object Model. The following
      features and terms are defined in the CSSOM specifications: [[!CSSOM]] [[!CSSOM-VIEW]]

      * <dfn><code>Screen</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>LinkStyle</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code></dfn>
      * <dfn><code>cssText</code></dfn> attribute of <code>CSSStyleDeclaration</code>
      * <dfn><code>StyleSheet</code></dfn>
      * The terms <dfn>create a CSS style sheet</dfn>, <dfn>remove a CSS style sheet</dfn>, and
        <dfn>associated CSS style sheet</dfn>
      * <dfn>CSS style sheets</dfn> and their properties: <dfn>type</dfn>, <dfn>location</dfn>,
        <dfn>parent CSS style sheet</dfn>, <dfn>owner node</dfn>, <dfn>owner CSS rule</dfn>,
        <dfn>media</dfn>, <dfn>title</dfn>, <dfn>alternate flag</dfn>, <dfn>disabled flag</dfn>,
        <dfn>CSS rules</dfn>, <dfn>origin-clean flag</dfn>
      * <dfn>Alternative style sheet sets</dfn> and the <dfn>preferred style sheet set</dfn>
      * <dfn>Serializing a CSS value</dfn>
      * <dfn>Scroll an element into view</dfn>
      * <dfn>Scroll to the beginning of the document</dfn>
      * The <dfn><code>resize</code></dfn> event
      * The <dfn><code>scroll</code></dfn> event

      The following features and terms are defined in the <cite>CSS Syntax</cite> specifications:
      [[!CSS3-SYNTAX]]

      * <dfn>Parse a comma-separated list of component values</dfn>
      * <dfn>component value</dfn>
      * <dfn>environment encoding</dfn>

      The feature <dfn>&lt;length></dfn> is defined in the <cite>CSS Values and Units</cite>
      specification. [[!CSS-VALUES]]

      The term <dfn>CSS styling attribute</dfn> is defined in the <cite>CSS Style Attributes</cite>
      specification. [[!CSS-STYLE-ATTR]]

      The <code>CanvasRenderingContext2D</code> object's use of fonts depends on the features

  This specification does not <em>require</em> support of any particular network protocol, style
  sheet language, scripting language, or any of the DOM specifications beyond those required in the
  list above. However, the language described by this specification is biased towards CSS as the
  styling language, JavaScript as the scripting language, and HTTP as the network protocol, and
  several features assume that those languages and protocols are in use.

  A user agent that implements the HTTP protocol must implement the Web Origin Concept
  specification and the HTTP State Management Mechanism specification (Cookies) as well. [[!HTTP11]]
  [[!ORIGIN]] [[!COOKIES]]

  <p class="note">
    This specification might have certain additional requirements on character encodings, image
    formats, audio formats, and video formats in the respective sections.

</div>

<h4 id="extensibility">Extensibility</h4>

  Vendor-specific proprietary user agent extensions to this specification are strongly discouraged.
  Documents must not use such extensions, as doing so reduces interoperability and fragments the
  user base, allowing only users of specific user agents to access the content in question.

  <div class="impl">
    If such extensions are nonetheless needed, e.g. for experimental purposes, then vendors are
    strongly urged to use one of the following extension mechanisms:

    * For markup-level features that can be limited to the XML serialization and need not be
        supported in the HTML serialization, vendors should use the namespace mechanism to define
        custom namespaces in which the non-standard elements and attributes are supported.

    * For markup-level features that are intended for use with <a>the HTML syntax</a>,
        extensions should be limited to new attributes of the form
        "<code>x-<var>vendor</var>-<var>feature</var></code>", where <var>vendor</var> is a short
        string that identifies the vendor responsible for the extension, and <var>feature</var> is
        the name of the feature. New element names should not be created. Using attributes for such
        extensions exclusively allows extensions from multiple vendors to co-exist on the same
        element, which would not be possible with elements. Using the
        "<code>x-<var>vendor</var>-<var>feature</var></code>" form allows extensions to be made
        without risk of conflicting with future additions to the specification.

      <div class="example">
        For instance, a browser named "FerretBrowser" could use "ferret" as a vendor prefix, while a
        browser named "Mellblom Browser" could use "mb". If both of these browsers invented
        extensions that turned elements into scratch-and-sniff areas, an author experimenting with
        these features could write:

        <pre highlight="html">
          &lt;p>This smells of lemons!
          &lt;span x-ferret-smellovision x-ferret-smellcode="LEM01"
          x-mb-outputsmell x-mb-smell="lemon juice">&lt;/span>&lt;/p>
        </pre>
      </div>

    Attribute names beginning with the two characters "<code>x-</code>" are reserved for
    user agent use and are guaranteed to never be formally added to the HTML language. For
    flexibility, attributes names containing underscores (the U+005F LOW LINE character) are also
    reserved for experimental purposes and are guaranteed to never be formally added to the HTML
    language.

    <p class="note">Pages that use such attributes are by definition non-conforming.</p>

    For DOM extensions, e.g. new methods and IDL attributes, the new members should be prefixed by
    vendor-specific strings to prevent clashes with future versions of this specification.

    For events, experimental event types should be prefixed with vendor-specific strings.

    <div class="example">
      For example, if a user agent called "Pleas<!--e h-->old" were to add an event to indicate when
      the user is going up in an elevator, it could use the prefix "<code>pleasold</code>" and
      thus name the event "<code>pleasoldgoingup</code>", possibly with an event handler attribute
      named "<code>onpleasoldgoingup</code>".</p>
    </div>

    All extensions must be defined so that the use of extensions neither contradicts nor causes the
    non-conformance of functionality defined in the specification.

    <div class="example">
      For example, while strongly discouraged from doing so, an implementation "Foo Browser" could
      add a new IDL attribute "<code>fooTypeTime</code>" to a control's DOM interface that returned
      the time it took the user to select the current value of a control (say). On the other hand,
      defining a new control that appears in a form's <code>elements</code> array would be in
      violation of the above requirement, as it would violate the definition of
      <code>elements</code> given in this specification.</p>
    </div>

    When adding new <a>reflecting</a> IDL attributes corresponding to content attributes of the form
    "<code>x-<var>vendor</var>-<var>feature</var></code>", the IDL attribute should be named
    "<code><var>vendor</var><var>Feature</var></code>" (i.e. the "<code>x</code>" is dropped from
    the IDL attribute's name).</p>
</div>

<hr />

  When vendor-neutral extensions to this specification are needed, either this specification can be
  updated accordingly, or an extension specification can be written that overrides the requirements
  in this specification. When someone applying this specification to their activities decides that
  they will recognize the requirements of such an extension specification, it becomes an
  <dfn>applicable specification</dfn> for the purposes of conformance requirements in this
  specification.

  <p class="note">
    Someone could write a specification that defines any arbitrary byte stream as conforming, and
    then claim that their random junk is conforming. However, that does not mean that their random
    junk actually is conforming for everyone's purposes: if someone else decides that that
    specification does not apply to their work, then they can quite legitimately say that the
    aforementioned random junk is just that, junk, and not conforming at all. As far as conformance
    goes, what matters in a particular community is what that community <em>agrees</em> is
    applicable.
  </p>

  <dfn>applicable specification</dfn>.

  The conformance terminology for documents depends on the nature of the changes introduced by such
  applicable specifications, and on the content and intended interpretation of the document.
  Applicable specifications MAY define new document content (e.g. a foobar element), MAY prohibit
  certain otherwise conforming content (e.g. prohibit use of &lt;table>s), or MAY change the
  semantics, DOM mappings, or other processing rules for content defined in this specification.
  Whether a document is or is not a <a>conforming HTML5 document</a> does not depend on the use of
  applicable specifications: if the syntax and semantics of a given <a>conforming HTML5 document</a>
  is unchanged by the use of applicable specification(s), then that document remains a
  <a>conforming HTML5 document</a>. If the semantics or processing of a given (otherwise conforming)
  document is changed by use of applicable specification(s), then it is not a
  <a>conforming HTML5 document</a>. For such cases, the applicable specifications SHOULD define
  conformance terminology.</p>

  <p class="note">
    As a suggested but not required convention, such specifications might define conformance
    terminology such as: "Conforming HTML5+XXX document", where XXX is a short name
    for the applicable specification. (Example: "Conforming HTML5+AutomotiveExtensions document").
  </p>

  <p class="note">a consequence of the rule given above is that certain syntactically correct HTML5
    documents may not be <a>conforming HTML5 documents</a> in the presence of applicable
    specifications. (Example: the applicable specification defines &lt;table> to be a piece of
    furniture &#8212; a document written to that specification and containing a &lt;table> element
    is NOT a <a>conforming HTML5 document</a>, even if the element happens to be syntactically
    correct HTML5.)
  </p>

<div class="impl">
  <hr />

  User agents must treat elements and attributes that they do not understand as semantically
  neutral; leaving them in the DOM (for DOM processors), and styling them according to CSS (for CSS
  processors), but not inferring any meaning from them.

  When support for a feature is disabled (e.g. as an emergency measure to mitigate a security
  problem, or to aid in development, or for performance reasons), user agents must act as if they
  had no support for the feature whatsoever, and as if the feature was not mentioned in this
  specification. For example, if a particular feature is accessed via an attribute in a Web IDL
  interface, the attribute itself would be omitted from the objects that implement that interface
  &mdash; leaving the attribute on the object but making it return null or throw an exception is
  insufficient.

<div class="impl">
  <h4 id="interactions-with-xpath-and-xslt">Interactions with XPath and XSLT</h4>

  Implementations of XPath 1.0 that operate on <a>HTML documents</a> parsed or created in the
  manners described in this specification (e.g. as part of the <code>document.evaluate()</code> API)
  must act as if the following edit was applied to the XPath 1.0 specification.

  First, remove this paragraph:

  <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116#node-tests">
    A <a>QName</a> in the node test is expanded into an <a>expanded-name</a> using the namespace
    declarations from the expression context. This is the same way expansion is done for element
    type names in start and end-tags except that the default namespace declared with
    <code>xmlns</code> is not used: if the <a>QName</a> does not have a prefix, then the namespace
    URI is null (this is the same way attribute names are expanded). It is an error if the
    <a>QName</a> has a prefix for which there is no namespace declaration in the expression context.
  </blockquote>

  Then, insert in its place the following:

  <blockquote cite="http://www.w3.org/Bugs/Public/show_bug.cgi?id=7059#c37">
    A QName in the node test is expanded into an expanded-name using the namespace declarations from
    the expression context. If the QName has a prefix, then there must be a namespace declaration
    for this prefix in the expression context, and the corresponding namespace URI is the one that
    is associated with this prefix. It is an error if the QName has a prefix for which there is no
    namespace declaration in the expression context.

    If the QName has no prefix and the principal node type of the axis is element, then the default
    element namespace is used. Otherwise if the QName has no prefix, the namespace URI is null. The
    default element namespace is a member of the context for the XPath expression. The value of the
    default element namespace when executing an XPath expression through the DOM3 XPath API is
    determined in the following way:

    1. If the context node is from an HTML DOM, the default element namespace is
        "http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml".
    2. Otherwise, the default element namespace URI is null.

    <p class="note">
      This is equivalent to adding the default element namespace feature of XPath 2.0 to XPath 1.0,
      and using the HTML namespace as the default element namespace for HTML documents. It is
      motivated by the desire to have implementations be compatible with legacy HTML content while
      still supporting the changes that this specification introduces to HTML regarding the
      namespace used for HTML elements, and by the desire to use XPath 1.0 rather than XPath 2.0.
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <p class="note">
    This change is a <a>willful violation</a> of the XPath 1.0 specification, motivated by
    desire to have implementations be compatible with legacy content while still supporting the
    changes that this specification introduces to HTML regarding which namespace is used for HTML
    elements. [[!XPATH]]
  </p>

  <hr />

  XSLT 1.0 processors outputting to a DOM when the output method is "html" (either explicitly or via
  the defaulting rule in XSLT 1.0) are affected as follows:

  If the transformation program outputs an element in no namespace, the processor must, prior to
  constructing the corresponding DOM element node, change the namespace of the element to the
  <a>HTML namespace</a>, <a>ASCII-lowercase</a> the element's local name, and <a>ASCII-lowercase</a>
  the names of any non-namespaced attributes on the element.

  <p class="note">
    This requirement is a <a>willful violation</a> of the XSLT 1.0 specification, required because
    this specification changes the namespaces and case-sensitivity rules of HTML in a manner that
    would otherwise be incompatible with DOM-based XSLT transformations. (Processors that serialize
    the output are unaffected.) [[!XSLT-19991116]]
  </p>

  <hr />

  This specification does not specify precisely how XSLT processing interacts with the
  <a>HTML parser</a> infrastructure (for example, whether an XSLT processor acts as if it puts any
  elements into a <a>stack of open elements</a>). However, XSLT processors must <a>stop parsing</a>
  if they successfully complete, and must set the <a>current document readiness</a> first to
  "<code>interactive</code>" and then to "<code>complete</code>" if they are aborted.

  <hr />

  This specification does not specify how XSLT interacts with the <a>navigation</a> algorithm, how
  it fits in with the <a>event loop</a>, nor how error pages are to be handled (e.g. whether XSLT
  errors are to replace an incremental XSLT output, or are rendered inline, etc).

  <p class="note">
    There are also additional non-normative comments regarding the interaction of XSLT and HTML
    <a>in the <code>script</code> element section</a>, and of XSLT, XPath, and HTML <a>in the

  The step <dfn>skip whitespace</dfn> means that the user agent must
  <a>collect a sequence of characters</a> that are <a>space characters</a>. The collected characters
  are not used.

  When a user agent is to <dfn>strip line breaks</dfn> from a string, the user agent must remove
  any U+000A LINE FEED (LF) and U+000D CARRIAGE RETURN (CR) characters from that string.

  When a user agent is to <dfn>strip leading and trailing whitespace</dfn> from a string, the
  user agent must remove all <a>space characters</a> that are at the start or end of the string.

  When a user agent is to <dfn>strip and collapse whitespace</dfn> in a string, it must replace any
  sequence of one or more consecutive <a>space characters</a> in that string with a single U+0020
  SPACE character, and then <a>strip leading and trailing whitespace</a> from that string.

  When a user agent has to <dfn>strictly split a string</dfn> on a particular delimiter character
  <var>delimiter</var>, it must use the following algorithm:

  1. Let <var>input</var> be the string being parsed.
  2. Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>input</var>, initially
      pointing at the start of the string.
  3. Let <var>tokens</var> be an ordered list of tokens, initially empty.
  4. While <var>position</var> is not past the end of <var>input</var>:
      1. <a>Collect a sequence of characters</a> that are not the <var>delimiter</var> character.
      2. Append the string collected in the previous step to <var>tokens</var>.
      3. Advance <var>position</var> to the next character in <var>input</var>.
  5. Return <var>tokens</var>.

  <p class="note">
    For the special cases of splitting a string <a>on spaces</a> and <a>on commas</a>, this
    algorithm does not apply (those algorithms also perform <a>whitespace trimming</a>).

<h4 id="boolean-attributes">Boolean attributes</h4>

  A number of attributes are <dfn>boolean attributes</dfn>. The presence of a boolean attribute on
  an element represents the true value, and the absence of the attribute represents the false value.

  If the attribute is present, its value must either be the empty string or a value that is an
  <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the attribute's canonical name, with no leading or
  trailing whitespace.

  <p class="note">
    The values "true" and "false" are not allowed on boolean attributes. To represent a false value,
    the attribute has to be omitted altogether.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    Here is an example of a checkbox that is checked and disabled. The <code>checked</code> and
    <code>disabled</code> attributes are the boolean attributes.

    <pre highlight="html">&lt;label>&lt;input type=checkbox checked name=cheese disabled> Cheese&lt;/label></pre>

    This could be equivalently written as this:

    <pre highlight="html">&lt;label>&lt;input type=checkbox checked=checked name=cheese disabled=disabled> Cheese&lt;/label></pre>

    You can also mix styles; the following is still equivalent:

    <pre highlight="html">&lt;label>&lt;input type='checkbox' checked name=cheese disabled=""> Cheese&lt;/label></pre>
  </div>

<h4 id="keywords-and-enumerated-attributes">Keywords and enumerated attributes</h4>

  Some attributes are defined as taking one of a finite set of keywords. Such attributes are called
  <dfn>enumerated attributes</dfn>. The keywords are each defined to map to a particular
  <em>state</em> (several keywords might map to the same state, in which case some of the keywords
  are synonyms of each other; additionally, some of the keywords can be said to be non-conforming,
  and are only in the specification for historical reasons). In addition, two default states can be
  given. The first is the <dfn><i>invalid value default</i></dfn>, the second is the
  <dfn><i>missing value default</i></dfn>.

  If an enumerated attribute is specified, the attribute's value must be an
  <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for one of the given keywords that are not said to be
  non-conforming, with no leading or trailing whitespace.

  When the attribute is specified, if its value is an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for one of
  the given keywords then that keyword's state is the state that the attribute represents. If the
  attribute value matches none of the given keywords, but the attribute has an
  <i>invalid value default</i>, then the attribute represents that state. Otherwise, if the
  attribute value matches none of the keywords but there is a <i>missing value default</i> state
  defined, then <em>that</em> is the state represented by the attribute. Otherwise, there is no
  default, and invalid values mean that there is no state represented.

  When the attribute is <em>not</em> specified, if there is a <i>missing value default</i> state
  defined, then that is the state represented by the (missing) attribute. Otherwise, the absence of
  the attribute means that there is no state represented.

  <p class="note">The empty string can be a valid keyword.</p>

  consisting of a year, a month, and a day, and a time, consisting of an hour, a minute, a second,
  and a fraction of a second, but expressed without a time zone. [[!GREGORIAN]]

  A string is a <dfn>valid floating date and time string</dfn> representing a date and time if it
  consists of the following components in the given order:

  1. A <a>valid date string</a> representing the date
  2. A U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (T) or a U+0020 SPACE character
  3. A <a>valid time string</a> representing the time

  A string is a <dfn>valid normalized floating date and time string</dfn> representing a date and

  1. A <a>valid date string</a> representing the date
  2. A U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (T)
  3. A <a>valid time string</a> representing the time, expressed as the shortest possible string for
      the given time (e.g. omitting the seconds component entirely if the given time is zero seconds

<h5 id="time-zones">Time zones</h5>

  A <dfn>time-zone offset</dfn> consists of a signed number of hours and minutes.

  A string is a <dfn>valid time-zone offset string</dfn> representing a time-zone offset if it
  consists of either:

  * A U+005A LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z character (Z), allowed only if the time zone is UTC
  * Or, the following components, in the given order:
    1. Either a U+002B PLUS SIGN character (+) or, if the time-zone offset is not zero, a U+002D
        HYPHEN-MINUS character (-), representing the sign of the time-zone offset
    2. Two <a>ASCII digits</a>, representing the hours component <var>hour</var> of the
        time-zone offset, in the range 0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var>hour</var>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;23
    3. Optionally, a U+003A COLON character (:)
    4. Two <a>ASCII digits</a>, representing the minutes component <var>minute</var> of the
        time-zone offset, in the range 0&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;<var>minute</var>&nbsp;&le;&nbsp;59

  <p class="note">
    This format allows for time-zone offsets from -23:59 to +23:59. In practice, however, right now
    the range of offsets of actual time zones is -12:00 to +14:00, and the minutes component of
    offsets of actual time zones is always either 00, 30, or 45. There is no guarantee that this
    will remain so forever, however; time zones are changed by countries at will and do not follow a
    standard.

  <p class="note">

<h5 id="global-dates-and-times">Global dates and times</h5>

  A <dfn>global date and time</dfn> consists of a specific <a>proleptic-Gregorian date</a>,
  consisting of a year, a month, and a day, and a time, consisting of an hour, a minute, a second,
  and a fraction of a second, expressed with a time-zone offset, consisting of a signed number of
  hours and minutes. [[!GREGORIAN]]

  A string is a <dfn>valid global date and time string</dfn> representing a date, time, and a
  time-zone offset if it consists of the following components in the given order:

  1. A <a>valid date string</a> representing the date
  2. A U+0054 LATIN CAPITAL LETTER T character (T) or a U+0020 SPACE character
  3. A <a>valid time string</a> representing the time
  4. A <a>valid time-zone offset string</a> representing the time-zone offset

  Times in dates before the formation of UTC in the mid twentieth century must be expressed and
  interpreted in terms of UT1 (contemporary Earth solar time at the 0&deg; longitude), not UTC (the
  approximation of UT1 that ticks in SI seconds). Time before the formation of time zones must be
  expressed and interpeted as UT1 times with explicit time zones that approximate the contemporary
  difference between the appropriate local time and the time observed at the location of Greenwich,
  London.

  <div class="example">
    The following are some examples of dates written as <a>valid global date and time strings</a>.

    : "<code>0037-12-13 00:00Z</code>"
    :: Midnight in areas using London time on the birthday of Nero (the Roman Emperor). See below
        for further discussion on which date this actually corresponds to.

    : "<code>1979-10-14T12:00:00.001-04:00</code>"
    :: One millisecond after noon on October 14th 1979, in the time zone in use on the east coast of
        the USA during daylight saving time.

    : "<code>8592-01-01T02:09+02:09</code>"
    :: Midnight UTC on the 1st of January, 8592. The time zone associated with that time is two
        hours and nine minutes ahead of UTC, which is not currently a real time zone, but is
        nonetheless allowed.

    Several things are notable about these dates:

    * Years with fewer than four digits have to be zero-padded. The date "37-12-13" would not be a
        valid date.
    * If the "<code>T</code>" is replaced by a space, it must be a single space character. The
        string "<code>2001-12-21&nbsp;&nbsp;12:00Z</code>" (with two spaces between the components)
        would not be parsed successfully.
    * To unambiguously identify a moment in time prior to the introduction of the Gregorian calendar
        (insofar as moments in time before the formation of UTC can be unambiguously identified),
        the date has to be first converted to the Gregorian calendar from the calendar in use at the
        time (e.g. from the Julian calendar). The date of Nero's birth is the 15th of December 37,
        in the Julian Calendar, which is the 13th of December 37 in the
        <a>proleptic Gregorian calendar</a>.
    * The time and time-zone offset components are not optional.
    * Dates before the year one can't be represented as a datetime in this version of HTML.
    * Times of specific events in ancient times are, at best, approximations, since time was not
        well coordinated or measured until relatively recent decades.
    * Time-zone offsets differ based on daylight savings time.

  <p class="note">
    The zone offset is not a complete time zone specification. When working with real date and time
    values, consider using a separate field for time zone, perhaps using IANA time zone IDs.

<h5 id="weeks">Weeks</h5>

  A <dfn>week</dfn> consists of a week-year number and a week number representing a seven-day period
  starting on a Monday. Each week-year in this calendaring system has either 52 or 53 such seven-day
  periods, as defined below. The seven-day period starting on the Gregorian date Monday December
  29th 1969 (1969-12-29) is defined as week number 1 in week-year 1970. Consecutive weeks are
  numbered sequentially. The week before the number 1 week in a week-year is the last week in the
  previous week-year, and vice versa. [[!GREGORIAN]]

  A week-year with a number <var>year</var> has 53 weeks if it corresponds to either a year
  <var>year</var> in the <a>proleptic Gregorian calendar</a> that has a Thursday as its first
  day (January 1st), or a year <var>year</var> in the <a>proleptic Gregorian calendar</a> that has
  a Wednesday as its first day (January 1st) and where <var>year</var> is a number divisible by 400,
  or a number divisible by 4 but not by 100. All other week-years have 52 weeks.

  The <dfn>week number of the last day</dfn> of a week-year with 53 weeks is 53; the week number of
  the last day of a week-year with 52 weeks is 52.

  <p class="note">
    The week-year number of a particular day can be different than the number of the year that
    contains that day in the <a>proleptic Gregorian calendar</a>. The first week in a week-year
    <var>y</var> is the week that contains the first Thursday of the Gregorian year <var>y</var>.

    1. Let <var>input</var> be the string being parsed.

            5. Increment <var>N</var> by <var>fraction</var>.
            6. <a>Skip whitespace</a>.

                Otherwise if <var>next character</var> is none of the above characters, then fail.

        10. Increment <var>component count</var>.
        11. Let <var>multiplier</var> be 1.

            <var>multiplier</var> to <var>months</var>.

            Otherwise, run these substeps:

            1. If <var>units</var> is <i>weeks</i>, multiply <var>multiplier</var> by 7 and set
                <var>units</var> to <i>days</i>.

<h4 id="space-separated-tokens">Space-separated tokens</h4>

  A <dfn>set of space-separated tokens</dfn> is a string containing zero or more words (known as

  A string containing a <a>set of space-separated tokens</a> may have leading or trailing

  An <dfn>unordered set of unique space-separated tokens</dfn> is a

  An <dfn>ordered set of unique space-separated tokens</dfn> is a
  <a>set of space-separated tokens</a> where none of the tokens are duplicated but where the order
  of the tokens is meaningful.

  <a>Sets of space-separated tokens</a> sometimes have a defined set of allowed values. When a set
  of allowed values is defined, the tokens must all be from that list of allowed values; other
  values are non-conforming. If no such set of allowed values is provided, then all values are

    can result in an error, in which case the URL is not resolvable.

    1. Let <var>url</var> be the <a>URL</a> being resolved.
    2. Let <var>encoding</var> be determined as follows:

    <h3 id="fetching-resources">Fetching resources</h3>

    <h4 id="terminology">Terminology</h4>

    User agents can implement a variety of transfer protocols, but this specification mostly defines
    behavior in terms of HTTP. [[!HTTP11]]

    The <dfn>HTTP GET method</dfn> is equivalent to the default retrieval action of the protocol.
    For example, RETR in FTP. Such actions are idempotent and safe, in HTTP terms.

    The <dfn>HTTP response codes</dfn> are equivalent to statuses in other protocols that have the
    same basic meanings. For example, a "file not found" error is equivalent to a 404 code, a server
    error is equivalent to a 5xx code, and so on.

    The <dfn>HTTP headers</dfn> are equivalent to fields in
    other protocols that have the same basic meaning. For example, the HTTP authentication headers
    are equivalent to the authentication aspects of the FTP protocol.

    A <dfn>referrer source</dfn> is either a <code>Document</code> or a <a>URL</a>.

    <h4 id="processing-model">Processing model</h4>

    When a user agent is to <dfn>fetch</dfn><!--FETCH--> a resource or <a>URL</a>, optionally
    <strong>from</strong> an origin <i>origin</i>, optionally <strong>using</strong> a specific
    <a>referrer source</a> as an <i>override referrer source</i>, and optionally with any of a
    <i>synchronous flag</i>, a <i>manual redirect flag</i>, a <i>force same-origin flag</i>, and a
    <i>block cookies flag</i>, the following steps must be run. (When a <em>URL</em> is to be
    fetched, the URL identifies a resource to be obtained.)

    1. If there is a specific <i>override referrer source</i>, and it is a <a>URL</a>, then let
        <var>referrer</var> be the <i>override referrer source</i>, and jump to the step labeled
        <i>clean referrer</i>.

    2. Let <var>document</var> be the appropriate <code>Document</code> as given by the following
        list:
        <dl class="switch">
          <dt>If there is a specific <i>override referrer source</i></dt>
          <dd>The <i>override referrer source</i>.</dd>

          <dt>When <a>navigating</a></dt>
          <dd>The <a>active document</a> of the <a>source browsing context</a>.</dd>

          <dt>When fetching resources for an element</dt>
          <dd>The element's <code>Document</code>.</dd>
        </dl>
    3. While <var>document</var> is <a>an <code>iframe</code> <code>srcdoc</code> document</a>, let
        <var>document</var> be <var>document</var>'s <a>browsing context</a>'s
        <a>browsing context container</a>'s <code>Document</code> instead.
    4. If the <a>origin</a> of <var>Document</var> is not a scheme/host/port tuple, then set
        <var>referrer</var> to the empty string and jump to the step labeled <i>clean referrer</i>.
    5. Let <var>referrer</var> be <a>the document's address</a> of <var>document</var>.
    6. <i>Clean referrer</i>: Apply the <a>URL parser</a> to <var>referrer</var> and let
        <var>parsed referrer</var> be the <a>resulting parsed URL</a>.
    7. Let <var>referrer</var> be the result of applying the <a>URL serializer</a> to
        <var>parsed referrer</var>, with the <i>exclude fragment flag</i> set.
    8. If <var>referrer</var> is not the empty string, is not a <a><code>data:</code> URL</a>, and
        is not the <a>URL</a> "<code>about:blank</code>", then generate the <i>address of the
        resource from which Request-URIs are obtained</i> as required by HTTP for the
        <code>Referer</code> (sic) header from <var>referrer</var>. [[!HTTP11]]

        Otherwise, the <code>Referer</code> (sic) header must be omitted, regardless of its value.
    9. If the algorithm was not invoked with the <i>synchronous flag</i>, perform the remaining
        steps <a>in parallel</a>.
    10. If the <code>Document</code> with which any <a>tasks</a> <a>queued</a> by this algorithm
        would be associated doesn't have an associated <a>browsing context</a>, then abort these
        steps.
    11. This is the <i>main step</i>.

        If the resource is to be obtained from an <a>application cache</a>, then use the data from
        that <a>application cache</a>, as if it had been obtained in the manner appropriate given
        its <a>URL</a>.

        If the resource is identified by an <a>absolute URL</a>, and the resource is to be obtained
        using an idempotent action (such as an HTTP GET <a>or equivalent</a>), and it is already
        being downloaded for other reasons (e.g. another invocation of this algorithm), and this
        request would be identical to the previous one (e.g. same <code>Accept</code> and
        <code>Origin</code> headers), and the user agent is configured such that it is to reuse the
        data from the existing download instead of initiating a new one, then use the results of the
        existing download instead of starting a new one.

        Otherwise, if the resource is identified by an <a>absolute URL</a> with a scheme that does
        not define a mechanism to obtain the resource (e.g. it is a <code>mailto:</code> URL) or
        that the user agent does not support, then act as if the resource was an HTTP 204 No Content
        response with no other metadata.

        Otherwise, if the resource is identified by the <a>URL</a>
        <dfn><code>about:blank</code></dfn>, then the resource is immediately available and consists
        of the empty string, with no metadata.

        Otherwise, at a time convenient to the user and the user agent, download (or otherwise
        obtain) the resource, applying the semantics of the relevant specifications (e.g. performing
        an HTTP GET or POST operation, or reading the file from disk, or expanding
        <a><code>data:</code> URLs</a>, etc).

        For the purposes of the <code>Referer</code> (sic) header, use the
        <i>address of the resource from which Request-URIs are obtained</i> generated in the earlier
        step.

        For the purposes of the <code>Origin</code> header, if the <a>fetching algorithm</a> was
        explicitly initiated from an <i>origin</i>, then
        <i>the origin that initiated the HTTP request</i> is <i>origin</i>. Otherwise, this is
        <i>a request from a "privacy-sensitive" context</i>. [[!ORIGIN]]
    12. If the algorithm was not invoked with the <i>block cookies flag</i>, and there are cookies
        to be set, then the user agent must run the following substeps:
        1. Wait until ownership of the <a>storage mutex</a> can be taken by this instance of the
            <a>fetching</a> algorithm.
        2. Take ownership of the <a>storage mutex</a>.
        3. Update the cookies. [[!COOKIES]]
            <a class="fingerprint" href="#fingerprinting-vector"><img height="21" src="images/fingerprint.png" width="15" alt="(This is a fingerprinting vector.)" /></a>
        4. Release the <a>storage mutex</a> so that it is once again free.
    13. If the fetched resource is an HTTP redirect <a>or equivalent</a>, then:

        <dl class="switch">
          <dt>
            If the <i>force same-origin flag</i> is set and the <a>URL</a> of the target of the
            redirect does not have the <a>same origin</a> as the <a>URL</a> for which the
            <a>fetch</a> algorithm was invoked
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Abort these steps and return failure from this algorithm, as if the remote host could

          <dt>If the <i>manual redirect flag</i> is set</dt>
          <dd>
            Continue, using the fetched resource (the redirect) as the result of the algorithm. If
            the calling algorithm subsequently requires the user agent to
            <dfn>transparently follow the redirect</dfn>, then the user agent must resume this
            algorithm from the <i>main step</i>, but using the target of the redirect as the
            resource to fetch, rather than the original resource.
          </dd>

          <dt>Otherwise</dt>
          <dd>
            First, apply any relevant requirements for redirects (such as showing any appropriate
            prompts). Then, redo <i>main step</i>, but using the target of the redirect as the
            resource to fetch, rather than the original resource. For HTTP requests, the new request
            must include the same headers as the original request, except for headers for which
            other requirements are specified (such as the <code>Host</code> header). [[!HTTP11]]

            <p class="note">
              The HTTP specification requires that 301, 302, and 307 redirects, when applied to
              methods other than the safe methods, not be followed without user confirmation. That
              would be an appropriate prompt for the purposes of the requirement in the paragraph
              above. [[!HTTP11]]
          </dd>
        </dl>
    14. If the algorithm was not invoked with the <i>synchronous flag</i>: When the resource is
        available, or if there is an error of some description, <a>queue a task</a> that uses the
        resource as appropriate. If the resource can be processed incrementally, as, for instance,
        with a progressively interlaced JPEG or an HTML file, additional tasks may be queued to
        process the data as it is downloaded. The <a>task source</a> for these <a>tasks</a> is the
        <a>networking task source</a>.

        Otherwise, return the resource or error information to the calling algorithm.

    If the user agent can determine the actual length of the resource being <a>fetched</a> for an
    instance of this algorithm, and if that length is finite, then that length is the file's
    <dfn>size</dfn>. Otherwise, the subject of the algorithm (that is, the resource being fetched)
    has no known <a>size</a>. (For example, the HTTP <code>Content-Length</code> header might
    provide this information.)

    The user agent must also keep track of the <dfn>number of bytes downloaded</dfn> for each
    instance of this algorithm. This number must exclude any out-of-band metadata, such as HTTP
    headers.

    <p class="note">
      The <a>application cache</a> processing model introduces some
      <a>changes to the networking model</a> to handle the returning of cached resources.

    <p class="note">
      The <a>navigation</a> processing model handles redirects itself, overriding the redirection
      handling that would be done by the fetching algorithm.
    </p>

    <p class="note">
      Whether the <a>type sniffing rules</a> apply to the fetched resource depends on the algorithm
      that invokes the rules &mdash; they are not always applicable.

    <h4 id="encrypted-http-and-related-security-concerns">Encrypted HTTP and related security concerns</h4>

    Anything in this specification that refers to HTTP also applies to HTTP-over-TLS, as represented
    by <a>URLs</a> representing the <code>https</code> scheme. [[!HTTP11]]

    <p class="warning">
      User agents should report certificate errors to the user and must either refuse to download
      resources sent with erroneous certificates or must act as if such resources were in fact
      served with no encryption.
    </p>

    User agents should warn the user that there is a potential problem whenever the user visits a
    page that the user has previously visited, if the page uses less secure encryption on the second
    visit.

    Not doing so can result in users not noticing man-in-the-middle attacks.

    <div class="example">
      If a user connects to a server with a self-signed certificate, the user agent could allow the
      connection but just act as if there had been no encryption. If the user agent instead allowed
      the user to override the problem and then displayed the page as if it was fully and safely
      encrypted, the user could be easily tricked into accepting man-in-the-middle connections.

      If a user connects to a server with full encryption, but the page then refers to an external
      resource that has an expired certificate, then the user agent will act as if the resource was
      unavailable, possibly also reporting the problem to the user. If the user agent instead
      allowed the resource to be used, then an attacker could just look for "secure" sites that used
      resources from a different host and only apply man-in-the-middle attacks to that host, for
      example taking over scripts in the page.

      If a user bookmarks a site that uses a CA-signed certificate, and then later revisits that
      site directly but the site has started using a self-signed certificate, the user agent could
      warn the user that a man-in-the-middle attack is likely underway, instead of simply acting as
      if the page was not encrypted.

    <h4 id="extracting-character-encodings-from-meta-elements">Extracting character encodings from <code>meta</code> elements</h4>

    The <dfn>algorithm for extracting a character encoding from a <code>meta</code> element</dfn>,
    given a string <var>s</var>, is as follows. It either returns a character encoding or nothing.

    1. Let <var>position</var> be a pointer into <var>s</var>, initially pointing at the start of
        the string.
    2. <i>Loop</i>: Find the first seven characters in <var>s</var> after <var>position</var> that
        are an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> match for the word "<code>charset</code>". If no such
        match is found, return nothing and abort these steps.
    3. Skip any <a>space characters</a> that immediately follow the word "<code>charset</code>"
        (there might not be any).
    4. If the next character is not a U+003D EQUALS SIGN (=), then move <var>position</var> to point
        just before that next character, and jump back to the step labeled <i>loop</i>.
    5. Skip any <a>space characters</a> that immediately follow the equals sign (there might not be
        any).
    6. Process the next character as follows:
        <dl class="switch">
          <dt>
            If it is a U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character (") and there is a later U+0022 QUOTATION
            MARK character (") in <var>s</var>
          </dt>
          <dt>
            If it is a U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (') and there is a later U+0027 APOSTROPHE
            character (') in <var>s</var>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            Return the result of <a>getting an encoding</a> from the substring that is between
            this character and the next earliest occurrence of this character.
          </dd>

          <dt>If it is an unmatched U+0022 QUOTATION MARK character (")</dt>
          <dt>If it is an unmatched U+0027 APOSTROPHE character (')</dt>
          <dt>If there is no next character</dt>
          <dd>Return nothing.</dd>

          <dt>Otherwise</dt>
          <dd>
            Return the result of <a>getting an encoding</a> from the substring that consists of this
            character up to but not including the first <a>space character</a> or U+003B SEMICOLON
            character (;), or the end of <var>s</var>, whichever comes first.
          </dd>
        </dl>

    <p class="note">
      This algorithm is distinct from those in the HTTP specification (for example, HTTP doesn't
      allow the use of single quotes and requires supporting a backslash-escape mechanism that is
      not supported by this algorithm). While the algorithm is used in contexts that, historically,
      were related to HTTP, the syntax as supported by implementations diverged some time ago.

<h4 id="cors-settings-attributes">CORS settings attributes</h4>

  A <dfn>CORS settings attribute</dfn> is an <a>enumerated attribute</a>. The following table lists
  the keywords and states for the attribute &mdash; the keywords in the left column map to the
  states in the cell in the second column on the same row as the keyword.

  <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Keyword</th>
      <th>State</th>
      <th>Brief description</th>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><dfn><code>anonymous</code></dfn></td>
      <td><dfn>Anonymous</dfn></td>
      <td>
        <a>Requests</a> for the element will have their <a>mode</a> set to "<code>cors</code>" and
        their <a>credentials mode</a> set to "<code>same-origin</code>".
      </td>
    <tr>
      <td><dfn><code>use-credentials</code></dfn></td>
      <td><dfn>Use Credentials</dfn></td>
      <td>
        <a>Requests</a> for the element will have their <a>mode</a> set to "<code>cors</code>" and
        their <a>credentials mode</a> set to "<code>include</code>".
      </td>
  </table>

  The empty string is also a valid keyword, and maps to the <a>Anonymous</a> state. The attribute's
  <i>invalid value default</i> is the <a>Anonymous</a> state. For the purposes of <a>reflection</a>,
  the canonical case for the <a>Anonymous</a> state is the <code>anonymous</code> keyword. The
  <i>missing value default</i>, used when the attribute is omitted, is the <dfn>No CORS</dfn> state.

<h3 id="common-dom-interfaces">Common DOM interfaces</h3>

<h4 id="reflecting-content-attributes-in-idl-attributes">Reflecting content attributes in IDL attributes</h4>

  Some IDL attributes are defined to <dfn>reflect</dfn> a particular content attribute. This means
  that on getting, the IDL attribute returns the current value of the content attribute, and on
  setting, the IDL attribute changes the value of the content attribute to the given value.

  <div class="impl">
    In general, on getting, if the content attribute is not present, the IDL attribute must act as
    if the content attribute's value is the empty string; and on setting, if the content attribute
    is not present, it must first be added.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code>DOMString</code> attribute whose content attribute is
    defined to contain a <a>URL</a>, then on getting, the IDL attribute must <a>resolve</a> the
    value of the content attribute relative to the element and return the resulting
    <a>absolute URL</a> if that was successful, or the empty string otherwise; and on setting, must
    set the content attribute to the specified literal value. If the content attribute is absent,
    the IDL attribute must return the default value, if the content attribute has one, or else the
    empty string.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code>DOMString</code> attribute whose content attribute is
    defined to contain one or more <a>URLs</a>, then on getting, the IDL attribute must <a>split the
    content attribute on spaces</a> and return the concatenation of <a>resolving</a> each token URL
    to an <a>absolute URL</a> relative to the element, with a single U+0020 SPACE character between
    each URL, ignoring any tokens that did not resolve successfully. If the content attribute is
    absent, the IDL attribute must return the default value, if the content attribute has one, or
    else the empty string. On setting, the IDL attribute must set the content attribute to the
    specified literal value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code>DOMString</code> attribute whose content attribute is
    an <a>enumerated attribute</a>, and the IDL attribute is <dfn>limited to only known values</dfn>,
    then, on getting, the IDL attribute must return the conforming value associated with the state
    the attribute is in (in its canonical case), if any, or the empty string if the attribute is in
    a state that has no associated keyword value or if the attribute is not in a defined state (e.g.
    the attribute is missing and there is no <i>missing value default</i>); and on setting, the
    content attribute must be set to the specified new value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a nullable <code>DOMString</code> attribute whose content
    attribute is an <a>enumerated attribute</a>, then, on getting, if the corresponding content
    attribute is in its <i>missing value default</i> then the IDL attribute must return null,
    otherwise, the IDL attribute must return the conforming value associated with the state the
    attribute is in (in its canonical case); and on setting, if the new value is null, the content
    attribute must be removed, and otherwise, the content attribute must be set to the specified new
    value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code>DOMString</code> attribute but doesn't fall into any
    of the above categories, then the getting and setting must be done in a transparent,
    case-preserving manner.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute is a <code>boolean</code> attribute, then on getting the IDL
    attribute must return true if the content attribute is set, and false if it is absent. On
    setting, the content attribute must be removed if the IDL attribute is set to false, and must be
    set to the empty string if the IDL attribute is set to true. (This corresponds to the rules for
    <a>boolean content attributes</a>.)

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has a signed integer type (<code>long</code>) then, on getting,
    the content attribute must be parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing signed integers</a>,
    and if that is successful, and the value is in the range of the IDL attribute's type, the
    resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range
    value, or if the attribute is absent, then the default value must be returned instead, or 0 if
    there is no default value. On setting, the given value must be converted to the shortest
    possible string representing the number as a <a>valid integer</a> and then that string must be
    used as the new content attribute value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has a signed integer type (<code>long</code>)
    that is <dfn>limited to only non-negative numbers</dfn> then, on getting, the content attribute
    must be parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing non-negative integers</a>, and if that
    is successful, and the value is in the range of the IDL attribute's type, the resulting value
    must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the
    attribute is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or &#x2212;1 if there is no
    default value. On setting, if the value is negative, the user agent must throw an
    <code>IndexSizeError</code> exception. Otherwise, the given value must be converted to the
    shortest possible string representing the number as a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> and then
    that string must be used as the new content attribute value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has an <em>unsigned</em> integer type (<code>unsigned long</code>)
    then, on getting, the content attribute must be parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing
    non-negative integers</a>, and if that is successful, and the value is in the range 0 to
    2147483647 inclusive, the resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or
    returns an out of range value, or if the attribute is absent, the default value must be returned
    instead, or 0 if there is no default value. On setting, first, if the new value is in the range
    0 to 2147483647, then let <var>n</var> be the new value, otherwise let <var>n</var> be the
    default value, or 0 if there is no default value; then, <var>n</var> must be converted to the
    shortest possible string representing the number as a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> and that
    string must be used as the new content attribute value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has an unsigned integer type (<code>unsigned long</code>) that is
    <dfn>limited to only non-negative numbers greater than zero</dfn>, then the behavior is similar
    to the previous case, but zero is not allowed. On getting, the content attribute must first be
    parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing non-negative integers</a>, and if that is
    successful, and the value is in the range 1 to 2147483647 inclusive, the resulting value must be
    returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range value, or if the attribute
    is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or 1 if there is no default value. On
    setting, if the value is zero, the user agent must throw an <code>IndexSizeError</code>
    exception. Otherwise, first, if the new value is in the range 1 to 2147483647, then let
    <var>n</var> be the new value, otherwise let <var>n</var> be the default value, or 1 if there is
    no default value; then, <var>n</var> must be converted to the shortest possible string
    representing the number as a <a>valid non-negative integer</a> and that string must be used as
    the new content attribute value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has a floating-point number type (<code>double</code> or
    <code>unrestricted double</code>), then, on getting, the content attribute must be parsed
    according to the <a>rules for parsing floating-point number values</a>, and if that is
    successful, the resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails, or if the
    attribute is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or 0.0 if there is no default
    value. On setting, the given value must be converted to the <a>best representation of the number
    as a floating-point number</a> and then that string must be used as the new content attribute
    value.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has a floating-point number type (<code>double</code> or
    <code>unrestricted double</code>) that is <dfn>limited to numbers greater than zero</dfn>, then
    the behavior is similar to the previous case, but zero and negative values are not allowed. On
    getting, the content attribute must be parsed according to the <a>rules for parsing
    floating-point number values</a>, and if that is successful and the value is greater than 0.0,
    the resulting value must be returned. If, on the other hand, it fails or returns an out of range
    value, or if the attribute is absent, the default value must be returned instead, or 0.0 if
    there is no default value. On setting, if the value is less than or equal to zero, then the
    value must be ignored. Otherwise, the given value must be converted to the
    <a>best representation of the number as a floating-point number</a> and then that string must be
    used as the new content attribute value.

    <p class="note">
      The values Infinity and Not-a-Number (NaN) values throw an exception on setting, as defined in
      the Web IDL specification. [[!WEBIDL]]
    </p>

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has the type <code>DOMTokenList</code> or
    <code>DOMSettableTokenList</code>, then on getting it must return a <code>DOMTokenList</code> or
    <code>DOMSettableTokenList</code> object (as appropriate) whose associated element is the
    element in question and whose associated attribute's local name is the name of the attribute in
    question. The same <code>DOMTokenList</code> or <code>DOMSettableTokenList</code> object must be
    returned every time for each attribute.

    If a reflecting IDL attribute has the type <code>HTMLElement</code>, or an interface that
    descends from <code>HTMLElement</code>, then, on getting, it must run the following algorithm
    (stopping at the first point where a value is returned):

    1. If the corresponding content attribute is absent, then the IDL attribute must return null.
    2. Let <var>candidate</var> be the element that the <code>document.getElementById()</code>
        method would find when called on the content attribute's element's <a>node document</a> if
        it were passed as its argument the current value of the corresponding content attribute.
    3. If <var>candidate</var> is null, or if it is not type-compatible with the IDL attribute, then
        the IDL attribute must return null.
    4. Otherwise, it must return <var>candidate</var>.

    On setting, if the given element has an <code>id</code> attribute, and has the same
    <a>home subtree</a> as the element of the attribute being set, and the given element is the
    first element in that <a>home subtree</a> whose <a>ID</a> is the value of that <code>id</code>
    attribute, then the content attribute must be set to the value of that <code>id</code>
    attribute. Otherwise, the content attribute must be set to the empty string.
  </div>

<h4 id="collections">Collections</h4>

  The <code>HTMLAllCollection</code>, <code>HTMLFormControlsCollection</code>,
  <code>HTMLOptionsCollection</code>, interfaces are <a>collections</a> derived from the
  <code>HTMLCollection</code> interface.

<h5 id="htmlallcollection">HTMLAllCollection</h5>

  The <code>HTMLAllCollection</code> interface is used for the legacy <code>document.all</code>
  attribute. It operates similarly to <code>HTMLCollection</code>; the main differences are that its
  <code>namedItem()</code> method returns an <code>HTMLCollection</code> object when there are
  multiple matching elements, and that its <code>item()</code> method can be used as a synonym for
  its <code>namedItem()</code> method.

  <p class="note">
    All <code>HTMLAllCollection</code> objects are rooted at a <code>Document</code> and have a
    filter that matches all elements, so the elements <a>represented by the collection</a> of an

  2. Let <var>transfer map</var> be the <i>transfer map</i> passed to the algorithm, if any, or the
      empty list otherwise.
  3. Let <var>memory</var> be an association list of pairs of objects, initially empty. This is used
      to handle duplicate references. In each pair of objects, one is called the <i>source</i>
      object and the other the <i>destination</i> object.
  4. For each mapping in <var>transfer map</var>, add a mapping from the <code>Transferable</code>
      object (the source object) to the placeholder object (the destination object) to
      <var>memory</var>.
  5. Let <var>output</var> be the value resulting from calling the <span>internal structured cloning
      algorithm</span> with <var>input</var> as the "<var>input</var>" argument, and
      <var>memory</var> as the "<var>memory</var>" argument.
  6. Return <var>output</var>.

  The <dfn>internal structured cloning algorithm</dfn> is always called with two arguments,
  <var>input</var> and <var>memory</var>, and its behavior is as follows:

  1. If <var>input</var> is the source object of a pair of objects in <var>memory</var>, then return
      the destination object in that pair of objects and abort these steps.
  2. If <var>input</var> is a primitive value, then return that value and abort these steps.
  3. Let <var>deep clone</var> be <i>none</i>.
  4. The <var>input</var> value is an object. Jump to the appropriate step below:

  5. Add a mapping from <var>input</var> (the source object) to <var>output</var> (the destination
      object) to <var>memory</var>.
  6. If <var>deep clone</var> is set to <i>map</i>, then run these substeps. These substeps use the

      Maps. [[!ECMA-262]]

      1. Let <var>original</var> be the List that is the value of <var>input</var>'s
          \[[MapData]] internal slot. [[!ECMA-262]]
      2. Let <var>source</var> be a new empty List.
      3. For each Record {\[[key]], \[[value]]} <var>entry</var> that is an
          element of <var>original</var>, run the following substeps:

              \[[key]], \[[value]]: <var>entry</var>.\[[value]]}.
          2. If <var>new entry</var>.\[[key]] is not <i>empty</i>, append <var>new entry</var> as the
              last element of <var>source</var>.
      4. Let <var>target</var> be the List that is the value of <var>output</var>'s
          \[[MapData]] internal slot.
      5. For each Record {\[[key]], \[[value]]} <var>entry</var> that is an
          element of <var>source</var>, run the following substeps:
          1. Let <var>key</var> have the value obtained from invoking the
              <a>internal structured cloning algorithm</a> recursively with <var>entry</var>.
              \[[key]] as the new "<var>input</var>" argument and <var>memory</var> as the
              new "<var>memory</var>" argument.
          2. Let <var>value</var> have the value obtained from invoking the
              <a>internal structured cloning algorithm</a> recursively with <var>entry</var>.
              \[[value]] as the new "<var>input</var>" argument and <var>memory</var> as
              the new "<var>memory</var>" argument.
          3. Let <var>new entry</var> be the Record {\[[key]]: <var>key</var>,
              \[[value]]: <var>value</var>}.
          4. Append <var>new entry</var> as the last element of <var>target</var>.

      6. Set <var>deep clone</var> to <i>own</i>.
  7. If <var>deep clone</var> is set to <i>set</i>, then run these substeps. These substeps use the
      terminology and typographic conventions used in the JavaScript specification's definition of
      Sets. [[!ECMA-262]]
      1. Let <var>source</var> be a copy of the List that is the value of <var>input</var>'s
          \[[SetData]] internal slot. [[!ECMA-262]]
      2. Let <var>target</var> be the List that is the value of <var>output</var>'s
          \[[SetData]] internal slot.
      3. For each <var>entry</var> that is an element of <var>source</var> that is not <i>empty</i>,
          run the following substeps:
          1. Let <var>new entry</var> have the value obtained from invoking the
              <a>internal structured cloning algorithm</a> recursively with <var>entry</var> as
              the new "<var>input</var>" argument and <var>memory</var> as the new
              "<var>memory</var>" argument.
          2. Append <var>new entry</var> as the last element of <var>target</var>.
      4. Set <var>deep clone</var> to <i>own</i>.
  8. If <var>deep clone</var> is set to <i>own</i>, then, for each enumerable own property in
      <var>input</var>, run the following steps:
      1. Let <var>name</var> be the name of the property.
      2. Let <var>source value</var> be the result of calling the \[[Get]] internal method
          of <var>input</var> with the argument <var>name</var>. If the \[[Get]] internal
          method of a property involved executing script, and that script threw an uncaught
          exception, then abort the overall <a>structured clone</a> algorithm, with that exception
          being passed through to the caller.
      3. Let <var>cloned value</var> be the result of invoking the
          <a>internal structured cloning algorithm</a> recursively with <var>source value</var> as
          the "<var>input</var>" argument and <var>memory</var> as the "<var>memory</var>" argument.
          If this results in an exception, then abort the overall <a>structured clone</a> algorithm,
          with that exception being passed through to the caller.
      4. Add a new property to <var>output</var> having the name <var>name</var>, and having the
          value <var>cloned value</var>, using CreateDataProperty(<var>output</var>,
          <var>name</var>, <var>cloned value</var>).

      The order of the properties in the <var>input</var> and <var>output</var> objects must be the
      same, and any properties whose \[[Get]] internal method involves running script must be
      processed in that same order.

      <p class="note">This does not walk the prototype chain.</p>

      <p class="note">
        Property descriptors, setters, getters, and analogous features are not copied in this process.
        For example, the property in the input could be marked as read-only, but in the output it would
        just have the default state (typically read-write, though that could depend on the scripting
        environment).
      </p>

      <p class="note">
        Properties of Array objects are not treated any differently than those of other Objects. In
        particular, this means that non-index properties of arrays are copied as well.
      </p>

  9. Return <var>output</var>.

  <p class="note">
    This algorithm preserves cycles and preserves the identity of duplicate objects in graphs.

<h2 id="dom">Semantics, structure, and APIs of HTML documents</h2>

<h3 id="documents">Documents</h3>

  Every XML and HTML document in an HTML UA is represented by a <{Document}> object.
  [[!DOM]]

  <dfn>The document's address</dfn> is the <i>URL associated with a <{Document}></i> (as
  defined in the DOM standard). It is initially set when the <{Document}> is created, but
  that can change during the lifetime of the <{Document}>; for example, it changes when
  the user <a>navigates</a> to a <a>fragment identifier</a> on the page and when the
  <code>pushState()</code> method is called with a new <a>URL</a>. [[!DOM]]

  <p class="warning">
    Interactive user agents typically expose <a>the document's address</a> in their user interface.
    This is the primary mechanism by which a user can tell if a site is attempting to impersonate
    another.
  </p>

  When a <{Document}> is created by a <a>script</a> using the <code>createDocument()</code>
  or <code>createHTMLDocument()</code> APIs, <a>the document's address</a> is the same as
  <a>the document's address</a> of the <a>responsible document</a> specified by the script's
  <a>settings object</a>, and the <{Document}> is both <a>ready for post-load tasks</a> and
  <a>completely loaded</a> immediately.

  <dfn>The document's referrer</dfn> is an <a>absolute URL</a> that can be set when the
  <{Document}> is created. If it is not explicitly set, then its value is the empty string.

  Each <{Document}> object has a <dfn>reload override flag</dfn> that is originally unset.
  The flag is set by the <code>document.open()</code> and <code>document.write()</code> methods in
  certain situations. When the flag is set, the <{Document}> also has a
  <dfn>reload override buffer</dfn> which is a Unicode string that is used as the source of the
  document when it is reloaded.

  When the user agent is to perform <dfn>an overridden reload</dfn>, given a
  <a>source browsing context</a>, it must act as follows:


  1. Let <var>source</var> be the value of the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s
    <a>reload override buffer</a>.

  2. Let <var>address</var> be the <a>browsing context</a>'s <a>active document</a>'s
    <a>address</a>.

  3. Let <var>HTTPS state</var> be the <a>HTTPS state</a> of the <a>browsing context</a>'s
    <a>active document</a>'s <code>Window</code>.

  4. <a>Navigate</a> the <a>browsing context</a> to a new <a>response</a> whose <{body}> is
    <var>source</var> and <a>HTTPS state</a> is <var>HTTPS state</var>, with
    <a>replacement enabled</a> and <a>exceptions enabled</a>. The <a>source browsing context</a>
    is that given to the <a>overridden reload</a> algorithm. When the <a>navigate</a> algorithm
    creates a <{Document}> object for this purpose, set that <{Document}>'s
    <a>reload override flag</a> and set its <a>reload override buffer</a> to <var>source</var>.

    When it comes time to <a>set the document's address</a> in the <a>navigation algorithm</a>,
    use <var>address</var> as the <a>override URL</a>.

<h3 id="elements">Elements</h3>

<h4 id="semantics">Semantics</h4>

  Elements, attributes, and attribute values in HTML are defined (by this specification) to have
  certain meanings (semantics). For example, the <code>ol</code> element represents an ordered list,
  and the <code>lang</code> attribute represents the language of the content.

  These definitions allow HTML processors, such as Web browsers or search engines, to present and
  use documents and applications in a wide variety of contexts that the author might not have
  considered.

  <div class="example">
    As a simple example, consider a Web page written by an author who only considered desktop
    computer Web browsers:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML>
      &lt;html>
        &lt;head>
          &lt;title>My Page&lt;/title>
        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
          &lt;h1>Welcome to my page&lt;/h1>
          &lt;p>I like cars and lorries and have a big Jeep!&lt;/p>
          &lt;h2>Where I live&lt;/h2>
          &lt;p>I live in a small hut on a mountain!&lt;/p>
        &lt;/body>
      &lt;/html>
    </pre>

    Because HTML conveys <em>meaning</em>, rather than presentation, the same page can also be used
    by a small browser on a mobile phone, without any change to the page. Instead of headings being
    in large letters as on the desktop, for example, the browser on the mobile phone might use the
    same size text for the whole the page, but with the headings in bold.

    But it goes further than just differences in screen size: the same page could equally be used by
    a blind user using a browser based around speech synthesis, which instead of displaying the page
    on a screen, reads the page to the user, e.g. using headphones. Instead of large text for the
    headings, the speech browser might use a different volume or a slower voice.

    That's not all, either. Since the browsers know which parts of the page are the headings, they
    can create a document outline that the user can use to quickly navigate around the document,
    using keys for "jump to next heading" or "jump to previous heading". Such features are
    especially common with speech browsers, where users would otherwise find quickly navigating a
    page quite difficult.

    Even beyond browsers, software can make use of this information. Search engines can use the
    headings to more effectively index a page, or to provide quick links to subsections of the page
    from their results. Tools can use the headings to create a table of contents (that is in fact
    how this very specification's table of contents is generated).

    This example has focused on headings, but the same principle applies to all of the semantics
    in HTML.
  </div>

  Authors must not use elements, attributes, or attribute values for purposes other than their
  appropriate intended semantic purpose, as doing so prevents software from correctly processing the
  page.

    <pre class="bad" highlight="html">

    <pre class="bad" highlight="html">
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
      &lt;html lang="en-GB"&gt;
        &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Demonstration &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;table&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt; My favourite animal is the cat. &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;tr&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;
                &mdash;&lt;a href="http://example.org/~ernest/"&gt;&lt;cite&gt;Ernest&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
                in an essay from 1992
              &lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;/tr&gt;
          &lt;/table&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>

    This would make software that relies on these semantics fail: for example, a speech browser that
    allowed a blind user to navigate tables in the document would report the quote above as a table,
    confusing the user; similarly, a tool that extracted titles of works from pages would extract
    "Ernest" as the title of a work, even though it's actually a person's name, not a title.

    A corrected version of this document might be:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;!DOCTYPE HTML&gt;
      &lt;html lang="en-GB"&gt;
        &lt;head&gt; &lt;title&gt; Demonstration &lt;/title&gt; &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
          &lt;blockquote&gt;
            &lt;p&gt; My favourite animal is the cat. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;/blockquote&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;
            &mdash;&lt;a href="http://example.org/~ernest/"&gt;Ernest&lt;/a&gt;,
            in an essay from 1992
          &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
      &lt;/html&gt;
    </pre>
  </div>

  Authors must not use elements, attributes, or attribute values that are not permitted by this
  specification or <a>other applicable specifications</a>, as doing so makes it significantly harder
  for the language to be extended in the future.

  <div class="example">
    In the next example, there is a non-conforming attribute value ("carpet") and a non-conforming
    attribute ("texture"), which is not permitted by this specification:

    <pre class="bad" highlight="html">&lt;label&gt;Carpet: &lt;input type="carpet" name="c" texture="deep pile"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</pre>

    Here would be an alternative and correct way to mark this up:

    <pre highlight="html">&lt;label&gt;Carpet: &lt;input type="text" class="carpet" name="c" data-texture="deep pile"&gt;&lt;/label&gt;</pre>
  </div>

  Through scripting and using other mechanisms, the values of attributes, text, and indeed the
  entire structure of the document may change dynamically while a user agent is processing it. The
  semantics of a document at an instant in time are those represented by the state of the document
  at that instant in time, and the semantics of a document can therefore change over time. User
  agents <span class="impl">must</span> update their presentation of the document as this occurs.

  <p class="example">
    HTML has a <code>progress</code> element that describes a progress bar. If its "value" attribute
    is dynamically updated by a script, the UA would update the rendering to show the progress
    changing.
  </p>

<h4 id="elements-in-the-dom">Elements in the DOM</h4>

  The nodes representing <a>HTML elements</a> in the DOM <span class="impl">must</span> implement,
  and expose to scripts, the interfaces listed for them in the relevant sections of this
  specification. This includes <a>HTML elements</a> in <a>XML documents</a>, even when those
  documents are in another context (e.g. inside an XSLT transform).

  Elements in the DOM <dfn data-x="represents">represent</dfn> things; that is, they have intrinsic
  <em>meaning</em>, also known as semantics.

  <p class="example">For example, an <code>ol</code> element represents an ordered list.</p>

  The basic interface, from which all the <a>HTML elements</a>' interfaces inherit,
  <span class="impl">and which must be used by elements that have no additional requirements,</span>
  is the <code>HTMLElement</code> interface.

  <pre class="idl" highlight="webidl">
    interface HTMLElement : Element {
      // metadata attributes
      attribute DOMString title;
      attribute DOMString lang;
      attribute boolean translate;
      attribute DOMString dir;
      [SameObject] readonly attribute DOMStringMap dataset;

      // user interaction
      attribute boolean hidden;
      void click();
      attribute long tabIndex;
      void focus();
      void blur();
      attribute DOMString accessKey;
      readonly attribute DOMString accessKeyLabel;
      attribute boolean draggable;
      [PutForwards=value] readonly attribute DOMSettableTokenList dropzone;
      attribute HTMLMenuElement? contextMenu;
      attribute boolean spellcheck;
      void forceSpellCheck();
    };
    HTMLElement implements GlobalEventHandlers;
    HTMLElement implements ElementContentEditable;

    interface HTMLUnknownElement : HTMLElement { };
  </pre>

  The <code>HTMLElement</code> interface holds methods and attributes related to a number of
  disparate features, and the members of this interface are therefore described in various different
  sections of this specification.

  <div class="impl">
    The <code>HTMLUnknownElement</code> interface must be used for <a>HTML elements</a> that are not
    defined by this specification (or <a>other applicable specifications</a>).
  </div>

<h4 id="element-definitions">Element definitions</h4>

  Each element in this specification has a definition that includes the following information:

  : <dfn>Categories</dfn>
  :: A list of <a>categories</a> to which the element belongs. These are used when defining the
      <a>content models</a> for each element.

  : <dfn>Contexts in which this element can be used</dfn>
  :: A <em>non-normative</em> description of where the element can be used. This information is
      redundant with the content models of elements that allow this one as a child, and is provided
      only as a convenience.

      <p class="note">
        For simplicity, only the most specific expectations are listed. For example, an element that
        is both <a>flow content</a> and <a>phrasing content</a> can be used anywhere that either
        <a>flow content</a> or <a>phrasing content</a> is expected, but since anywhere that
        <a>flow content</a> is expected, <a>phrasing content</a> is also expected (since all
        <a>phrasing content</a> is <a>flow content</a>), only "where <a>phrasing content</a> is
        expected" will be listed.
      </p>

  : <dfn>Content model</dfn>
  :: A normative description of what content must be included as children and descendants of the
      element.

  : <dfn>Tag omission in text/html</dfn>
  :: A <em>non-normative</em> description of whether, in the <code>text/html</code> syntax, the
      <a>start</a> and <a>end</a> tags can be omitted. This information is redundant with the
      normative requirements given in the <a>optional tags</a> section, and is provided in the
      element definitions only as a convenience.

  : <dfn>Content attributes</dfn>
  :: A normative list of attributes that may be specified on the element (except where otherwise
      disallowed), along with non-normative descriptions of those attributes. (The content to the
      left of the dash is normative, the content to the right of the dash is not.)

  : Allowed <a>ARIA role attribute</a> values
  :: A normative list of <a>ARIA role attribute</a> values that may be specified on the element
      (except where otherwise disallowed). Each value is linked to a non normative description.

  : Allowed <a>ARIA state and property attributes</a>
  :: Links to the <a>Global aria-* attributes</a> list and the
      <a>allowed roles, states and properties</a> table.

  : <dfn>DOM interface</dfn>
  :: A normative definition of a DOM interface that such elements must implement.

  This is then followed by a description of what the element <a>represents</a>, along with any
  additional normative conformance criteria that may apply to authors
  <span class="impl"> and implementations</span>. Examples are sometimes also included.

<h5 id="attributes">Attributes</h5>

  Except where otherwise specified, attributes on <a>HTML elements</a> may have any string value,
  including the empty string. Except where explicitly stated, there is no restriction on what text
  can be specified in such attributes.

<h4 id="content-models"><dfn>Content models</dfn></h4>

  Each element defined in this specification has a content model: a description of the element's
  expected <a>contents</a>. An <a>HTML element</a> must have contents that match the requirements
  described in the element's content model. The <dfn>contents</dfn> of an element are its children
  in the DOM, except for <code>template</code> elements, where the children are those in the
  <a>template contents</a> (a separate <code>DocumentFragment</code> assigned to the element when
  the element is created).

  The <a>space characters</a> are always allowed between elements. User agents represent these
  characters between elements in the source markup as <code>Text</code> nodes in the DOM. Empty
  <code>Text</code> nodes and <code>Text</code> nodes consisting of just sequences of those
  characters are considered <dfn>inter-element whitespace</dfn>.

  <a>Inter-element whitespace</a>, comment nodes, and processing instruction nodes must be ignored
  when establishing whether an element's contents match the element's content model or not, and must
  be ignored when following algorithms that define document and element semantics.

  <p class="note">
    Thus, an element <var>A</var> is said to be <i>preceded or followed</i> by a second element
    <var>B</var> if <var>A</var> and <var>B</var> have the same parent node and there are no other
    element nodes or <code>Text</code> nodes (other than <a>inter-element whitespace</a>) between
    them. Similarly, a node is the <i>only child</i> of an element if that element contains no other
    nodes other than <a>inter-element whitespace</a>, comment nodes, and processing instruction
    nodes.
  </p>

  Authors must not use <a>HTML elements</a> anywhere except where they are explicitly allowed, as
  defined for each element, or as explicitly required by other specifications. For XML compound
  documents, these contexts could be inside elements from other namespaces, if those elements are
  defined as providing the relevant contexts.

  <div class="example">
    For example, the Atom specification defines a <code>content</code> element. When its
    <code>type</code> attribute has the value <code>xhtml</code>, the Atom specification requires
    that it contain a single HTML <code>div</code> element. Thus, a <code>div</code> element is
    allowed in that context, even though this is not explicitly normatively stated by this
    specification. [[!ATOM]]
  </div>

  In addition, <a>HTML elements</a> may be orphan nodes (i.e. without a parent node).

  <div class="example">
    For example, creating a <code>td</code> element and storing it in a global variable in a
    script is conforming, even though <code>td</code> elements are otherwise only supposed to be used
    inside <code>tr</code> elements.

    <pre>
      var data = {
        name: "Banana",
        cell: document.createElement('td'),
      };
    </pre>
  </div>

<h5 id="the-"nothing"-content-model">The "nothing" content model</h5>

  When an element's content model is <dfn>nothing</dfn>, the element must contain no
  <code>Text</code> nodes (other than <a>inter-element whitespace</a>) and no element nodes.

  <p class="note">
    Most HTML elements whose content model is "nothing" are also, for convenience,
    <a>void elements</a> (elements that have no <a>end tag</a> in the <a>HTML syntax</a>). However,
    these are entirely separate concepts.
  </p>

  <h5 id="kinds-of-content">Kinds of content</h5>

  Each element in HTML falls into zero or more <dfn>categories</dfn> that group elements with
  similar characteristics together. The following broad categories are used in this specification:

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><a>Metadata content</a></li>
    <li><a>Flow content</a></li>
    <li><a>Sectioning content</a></li>
    <li><a>Heading content</a></li>
    <li><a>Phrasing content</a></li>
    <li><a>Embedded content</a></li>
    <li><a>Interactive content</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    Some elements also fall into other categories, which are defined in other parts of this
    specification.
  </p>

  These categories are related as follows:

  <object width="1000" height="288" data="images/content-venn.svg"><img src="images/content-venn.png" alt="" width="512" height="288"></object>

  Sectioning content, heading content, phrasing content, embedded content, and interactive content
  are all types of flow content. Metadata is sometimes flow content. Metadata and interactive
  content are sometimes phrasing content. Embedded content is also a type of phrasing content, and
  sometimes is interactive content.

  Other categories are also used for specific purposes, e.g. form controls are specified using a
  number of categories to define common requirements. Some elements have unique requirements and do
  not fit into any particular category.

<h6 id="metadata-content">Metadata content</h6>

  <dfn>Metadata content</dfn> is content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of
  the content, or that sets up the relationship of the document with other documents, or that
  conveys other "out of band" information.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><code>base</code></li>
    <li><code>link</code></li>
    <li><code>meta</code></li>
    <li><code>noscript</code></li>
    <li><code>script</code></li>
    <li><code>style</code></li>
    <li><code>template</code></li>
    <li><code>title</code></li>
  </ul>

  Elements from other namespaces whose semantics are primarily metadata-related (e.g. RDF) are also
  <a>metadata content</a>.

  <div class="example">
    Thus, in the XML serialization, one can use RDF, like this:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:r="http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#">
        &lt;head>
          &lt;title>Hedral's Home Page&lt;/title>
          &lt;r:RDF>
            &lt;Person xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact#"
                       r:about="http://hedral.example.com/#">
              &lt;fullName>Cat Hedral&lt;/fullName>
              &lt;mailbox r:resource="mailto:hedral@damowmow.com"/>
              &lt;personalTitle>Sir&lt;/personalTitle>
            &lt;/Person>
          &lt;/r:RDF>
        &lt;/head>
        &lt;body>
          &lt;h1>My home page&lt;/h1>
          &lt;p>I like playing with string, I guess. Sister says squirrels are fun
          too so sometimes I follow her to play with them.&lt;/p>
        &lt;/body>
      &lt;/html>
    </pre>

    This isn't possible in the HTML serialization, however.
  </div>

<h6 id="flow-content">Flow content</h6>

  Most elements that are used in the body of documents and applications are categorized as
  <dfn>flow content</dfn>.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><code>a</code></li>

<h6 id="sectioning-content">Sectioning content</h6>

  <dfn>Sectioning content</dfn> is content that defines the scope of <a>headings</a> and
  <a>footers</a>.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><code>article</code></li>
    <li><code>aside</code></li>
    <li><code>nav</code></li>
    <li><code>section</code></li>
  </ul>

  Each <a>sectioning content</a> element potentially has a heading and an <a>outline</a>. See the
  section on <a>headings and sections</a> for further details.

  <p class="note">
    There are also certain elements that are <a>sectioning roots</a>. These are distinct from
    <a>sectioning content</a>, but they can also have an <a>outline</a>.
  </p>

<h6 id="heading-content">Heading content</h6>

  <dfn>Heading content</dfn> defines the header of a section (whether explicitly marked up using
  <a>sectioning content</a> elements, or implied by the heading content itself).

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><code>h1</code></li>
    <li><code>h2</code></li>
    <li><code>h3</code></li>
    <li><code>h4</code></li>
    <li><code>h5</code></li>
    <li><code>h6</code></li>
  </ul>

<h6 id="phrasing-content">Phrasing content</h6>

  <dfn>Phrasing content</dfn> is the text of the document, as well as elements that mark up that
  text at the intra-paragraph level. Runs of <a>phrasing content</a> form <a>paragraphs</a>.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><code>a</code></li>
    <li><code>abbr</code></li>
    <li><code>area</code> (if it is a descendant of a <code>map</code> element)</li>

    <li><code>wbr</code></li>
    <li><a>Text</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p class="note">
    Most elements that are categorized as phrasing content can only contain elements that are
    themselves categorized as phrasing content, not any flow content.
  </p>

  <dfn>Text</dfn>, in the context of content models, means either nothing, or <code>Text</code>
  nodes. <a>Text</a> is sometimes used as a content model on its own, but is also
  <a>phrasing content</a>, and can be <a>inter-element whitespace</a> (if the <code>Text</code>
  nodes are empty or contain just <a>space characters</a>).

  <code>Text</code> nodes and attribute values must consist of <a>Unicode characters</a>, must not
  contain U+0000 characters, must not contain permanently undefined Unicode characters
  (noncharacters), and must not contain <a>control characters</a> other than
  <a>space characters</a>.

  This specification includes extra constraints on the exact value of <code>Text</code> nodes and
  attribute values depending on their precise context.

<h6 id="embedded-content">Embedded content</h6>

  <dfn id="embedded-content-category">Embedded content</dfn> is content that imports another
  resource into the document, or content from another vocabulary that is inserted into the document.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><code>audio</code></li>
    <li><code>canvas</code></li>
    <li><code>embed</code></li>
    <li><code>iframe</code></li>

    <li><code>math</code></li>
    <li><code>object</code></li>
    <li><code>picture</code></li>
    <li><code>svg</code></li>
    <li><code>video</code></li>
  </ul>

  Elements that are from namespaces other than the <a>HTML namespace</a> and that convey content but
  not metadata, are <a>embedded content</a> for the purposes of the content models defined in this
  specification. (For example, MathML, or SVG.)

  Some embedded content elements can have <dfn>fallback content</dfn>: content that is to be used
  when the external resource cannot be used (e.g. because it is of an unsupported format). The
  element definitions state what the fallback is, if any.

<h6 id="interactive-content">Interactive content</h6>

  <dfn>Interactive content</dfn> is content that is specifically intended for user interaction.

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><code>a</code></li>
    <li><code>audio</code> (if the <code>controls</code> attribute is present)</li>
    <li><code>button</code></li>
    <li><code>details</code></li>
    <li><code>embed</code></li>
    <li><code>iframe</code></li>
    <li><code>img</code> (if the <code>usemap</code> attribute is present)</li>
    <li>
      <code>input</code> (if the <code>type</code> attribute is <em>not</em> in the <a>Hidden</a>
      state)
    </li>
    <li><code>keygen</code></li>
    <li><code>label</code></li>
    <li><code>object</code> (if the <code>usemap</code> attribute is present)</li>
    <li><code>select</code></li>
    <li><code>textarea</code></li>
    <li><a>sorting interface <code>th</code> elements</a></li>
    <li><code>video</code> (if the <code>controls</code> attribute is present)</li>
  </ul>

  The <code>tabindex</code> attribute can also make any element into <a>interactive content</a>.

<h6 id="palpable-content">Palpable content</h6>

  As a general rule, elements whose content model allows any <a>flow content</a> or
  <a>phrasing content</a> should have at least one node in its <a>contents</a> that is
  <dfn>palpable content</dfn> and that does not have the <code>hidden</code> attribute specified.

  <p class="note">
    <a>Palpable content</a> makes an element non-empty by providing either some descendant non-empty
    <a>text</a>, or else something users can hear (<code>audio</code> elements) or view
    (<code>video</code> or <code>img</code> or <code>canvas</code> elements) or otherwise interact
    with (for example, interactive form controls).
  </p>

  This requirement is not a hard requirement, however, as there are many cases where an element can
  be empty legitimately, for example when it is used as a placeholder which will later be filled in
  by a script, or when the element is part of a template and would on most pages be filled in but on
  some pages is not relevant.

  Conformance checkers are encouraged to provide a mechanism for authors to find elements that fail
  to fulfill this requirement, as an authoring aid.

  The following elements are palpable content:

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><code>a</code></li>
    <li><code>abbr</code></li>
    <li><code>address</code></li>

    <li><a>Text</a> that is not <a>inter-element whitespace</a></li>
  </ul>

<h6 id="script-supporting-elements">Script-supporting elements</h6>

  <dfn>Script-supporting elements</dfn> are those that do not <a>represent</a> anything themselves
  (i.e. they are not rendered), but are used to support scripts, e.g. to provide functionality for
  the user.

  The following elements are script-supporting elements:

  <ul class="brief category-list">
    <li><code>script</code></li>
    <li><code>template</code></li>
  </ul>

<h5 id="transparent-content-models">Transparent content models</h5>

  Some elements are described as <dfn>transparent</dfn>; they have "transparent" in the description
  of their content model. The content model of a <a>transparent</a> element is derived from the
  content model of its parent element: the elements required in the part of the content model that
  is "transparent" are the same elements as required in the part of the content model of the parent
  of the transparent element in which the transparent element finds itself.

  <div class="example">
    For instance, an <code>ins</code> element inside a <code>ruby</code> element cannot contain an
    <code>rt</code> element, because the part of the <code>ruby</code> element's content model that
    allows <code>ins</code> elements is the part that allows <a>phrasing content</a>, and the
    <code>rt</code> element is not <a>phrasing content</a>.
  </div>

  <p class="note">
    In some cases, where transparent elements are nested in each other, the process has to be
    applied iteratively.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    Consider the following markup fragment:

    <pre highlight="html">&lt;p>&lt;object>&lt;param>&lt;ins>&lt;map>&lt;a href="/">Apples&lt;/a>&lt;/map>&lt;/ins>&lt;/object>&lt;/p></pre>

    To check whether "Apples" is allowed inside the <code>a</code> element, the content models are
    examined. The <code>a</code> element's content model is transparent, as is the <code>map</code>
    element's, as is the <code>ins</code> element's, as is the part of the <code>object</code>
    element's in which the <code>ins</code> element is found. The <code>object</code> element is
    found in the <code>p</code> element, whose content model is <a>phrasing content</a>. Thus,
    "Apples" is allowed, as text is phrasing content.
  </div>

  When a transparent element has no parent, then the part of its content model that is "transparent"
  must instead be treated as accepting any <a>flow content</a>.

<h5 id="paragraphs">Paragraphs</h5>

  <p class="note">
    The term <a>paragraph</a> as defined in this section is used for more than just the definition
    of the <code>p</code> element. The <a>paragraph</a> concept defined here is used to describe how
    to interpret documents. The <code>p</code> element is merely one of several ways of marking up a
    <a>paragraph</a>.
  </p>

  A <dfn>paragraph</dfn> is typically a run of <a>phrasing content</a> that forms a block of text
  with one or more sentences that discuss a particular topic, as in typography, but can also be used
  for more general thematic grouping. For instance, an address is also a paragraph, as is a part of
  a form, a byline, or a stanza in a poem.

  <div class="example">
    In the following example, there are two paragraphs in a section. There is also a heading,
    which contains phrasing content that is not a paragraph. Note how the comments and
    <a>inter-element whitespace</a> do not form paragraphs.

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;section>
        &lt;h2>Example of paragraphs&lt;/h2>
        This is the &lt;em>first&lt;/em> paragraph in this example.
        &lt;p>This is the second.&lt;/p>
        &lt;!-- This is not a paragraph. -->
      &lt;/section>
    </pre>
  </div>

  Paragraphs in <a>flow content</a> are defined relative to what the document looks like without the
  <code>a</code>, <code>ins</code>, <code>del</code>, and <code>map</code> elements complicating
  matters, since those elements, with their hybrid content models, can straddle paragraph
  boundaries, as shown in the first two examples below.

  <p class="note">
    Generally, having elements straddle paragraph boundaries is best avoided. Maintaining such
    markup can be difficult.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    The following example takes the markup from the earlier example and puts <code>ins</code> and
    <code>del</code> elements around some of the markup to show that the text was changed (though in
    this case, the changes admittedly don't make much sense). Notice how this example has exactly
    the same paragraphs as the previous one, despite the <code>ins</code> and <code>del</code>
    elements &mdash; the <code>ins</code> element straddles the heading and the first paragraph, and
    the <code>del</code> element straddles the boundary between the two paragraphs.

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;section>
        &lt;ins>&lt;h1>Example of paragraphs&lt;/h1>
        This is the &lt;em>first&lt;/em> paragraph in&lt;/ins> this example&lt;del>.
        &lt;p>This is the second.&lt;/p>&lt;/del>
        &lt;!-- This is not a paragraph. -->
      &lt;/section>
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="impl">
    Let <var>view</var> be a view of the DOM that replaces all <code>a</code>, <code>ins</code>,
    <code>del</code>, and <code>map</code> elements in the document with their
    <span>contents</span>. Then, in <var>view</var>, for each run of sibling <a>phrasing content</a>
    nodes uninterrupted by other types of content, in an element that accepts content other than
    <a>phrasing content</a> as well as <a>phrasing content</a>, let <var>first</var> be the first
    node of the run, and let <var>last</var> be the last node of the run. For each such run that
    consists of at least one node that is neither <a>embedded content</a> nor
    <a>inter-element whitespace</a>, a paragraph exists in the original DOM from immediately before
    <var>first</var> to immediately after <var>last</var>. (Paragraphs can thus span across
    <code>a</code>, <code>ins</code>, <code>del</code>, and <code>map</code> elements.)

    Conformance checkers may warn authors of cases where they have paragraphs that overlap each
    other (this can happen with <code>object</code>, <code>video</code>, <code>audio</code>, and
    <code>canvas</code> elements, and indirectly through elements in other namespaces that allow
    HTML to be further embedded therein, like <code>svg</code> or <code>math</code>).
  </div>

  A <a>paragraph</a> is also formed explicitly by <code>p</code> elements.

  <p class="note">
    The <code>p</code> element can be used to wrap individual paragraphs when there would otherwise
    not be any content other than phrasing content to separate the paragraphs from each other.
  </p>

  <div class="example">
    In the following example, the link spans half of the first paragraph, all of the heading
    separating the two paragraphs, and half of the second paragraph. It straddles the paragraphs and
    the heading.

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;header>
        Welcome!
        &lt;a href="about.html">
          This is home of...
          &lt;h1>The Falcons!&lt;/h1>
          The Lockheed Martin multirole jet fighter aircraft!
        &lt;/a>
        This page discusses the F-16 Fighting Falcon's innermost secrets.
      &lt;/header>
    </pre>

    Here is another way of marking this up, this time showing the paragraphs explicitly, and
    splitting the one link element into three:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;header>
        &lt;p>Welcome! &lt;a href="about.html">This is home of...&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
        &lt;h1>&lt;a href="about.html">The Falcons!&lt;/a>&lt;/h1>
        &lt;p>&lt;a href="about.html">The Lockheed Martin multirole jet
        fighter aircraft!&lt;/a> This page discusses the F-16 Fighting
        Falcon's innermost secrets.&lt;/p>
      &lt;/header>
    </pre>
  </div>

  <div class="example">
    It is possible for paragraphs to overlap when using certain elements that define fallback
    content. For example, in the following section:

    <pre highlight="html">
      &lt;section>
        &lt;h2>My Cats&lt;/h2>
        You can play with my cat simulator.
        &lt;object data="cats.sim">
          To see the cat simulator, use one of the following links:
          &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>&lt;a href="cats.sim">Download simulator file&lt;/a>
            &lt;li>&lt;a href="http://sims.example.com/watch?v=LYds5xY4INU">Use online simulator&lt;/a>
          &lt;/ul>
          Alternatively, upgrade to the Mellblom Browser.
        &lt;/object>
        I'm quite proud of it.
      &lt;/section>
    </pre>

    There are five paragraphs:

    1. The paragraph that says "You can play with my cat simulator. <i>object</i> I'm quite proud of
        it.", where <i>object</i> is the <code>object</code> element.
    2. The paragraph that says "To see the cat simulator, use one of the following links:".
    3. The paragraph that says "Download simulator file".
    4. The paragraph that says "Use online simulator".
    5. The paragraph that says "Alternatively, upgrade to the Mellblom Browser.".

    The first paragraph is overlapped by the other four. A user agent that supports the "cats.sim"
    resource will only show the first one, but a user agent that shows the fallback will confusingly
    show the first sentence of the first paragraph as if it was in the same paragraph as the second
    one, and will show the last paragraph as if it was at the start of the second sentence of the
    first paragraph.

    To avoid this confusion, explicit <code>p</code> elements can be used. For example:

    <pre>
      &lt;section>
        &lt;h2>My Cats&lt;/h2>
        &lt;p>You can play with my cat simulator.&lt;/p>
        &lt;object data="cats.sim">
          &lt;p>To see the cat simulator, use one of the following links:&lt;/p>
          &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>&lt;a href="cats.sim">Download simulator file&lt;/a>
            &lt;li>&lt;a href="http://sims.example.com/watch?v=LYds5xY4INU">Use online simulator&lt;/a>
          &lt;/ul>
          &lt;p>Alternatively, upgrade to the Mellblom Browser.&lt;/p>
        &lt;/object>
        &lt;p>I'm quite proud of it.&lt;/p>
      &lt;/section>

  <p class="note">
    The attributes marked with an asterisk have a different meaning when specified on
    <code>body</code> elements as those elements expose <a>event handlers</a> of the
    <code>Window</code> object with the same names.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    While these attributes apply to all elements, they are not useful on all elements. For example,
    only <a>media elements</a> will ever receive a <code>volumechange</code> event fired by the user
    agent.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <a>Custom data attributes</a> (e.g. <code>data-foldername</code> or <code>data-msgid</code>) can
  be specified on any <a>HTML element</a>, to store custom data specific to the page.

  <hr />

  In <a>HTML documents</a>, elements in the <a>HTML namespace</a> may have an <code>xmlns</code>
  attribute specified, if, and only if, it has the exact value
  "<code>http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml</code>". This does not apply to <a>XML documents</a>.

  <p class="note">
    In HTML, the <code>xmlns</code> attribute has absolutely no effect. It is basically a talisman.
    It is allowed merely to make migration to and from XHTML mildly easier. When parsed by an
    <a>HTML parser</a>, the attribute ends up in no namespace, not the
    "<code>http://www.w3.org/2000/xmlns/</code>" namespace like namespace declaration attributes in
    XML do.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    In XML, an <code>xmlns</code> attribute is part of the namespace declaration mechanism, and an
    element cannot actually have an <code>xmlns</code> attribute in no namespace specified.
  </p>

  <hr />

  The XML specification also allows the use of the <code>xml:space</code> attribute in the
  <a>XML namespace</a> on any element in an <a>XML document</a>. This attribute has no effect on
  <a>HTML elements</a>, as the default behavior in HTML is to preserve whitespace. [[!XML]]

  <p class="note">
    There is no way to serialize the <code>xml:space</code> attribute on <a>HTML elements</a> in the
    <code>text/html</code> syntax.
  </p>

<h5 id="the-id-attribute">The <dfn><code>id</code></dfn> attribute</h5>

  The <code>id</code> attribute specifies its element's <a>unique identifier (ID)</a>. [[!DOM]]

  The value must be unique amongst all the <a>IDs</a> in the element's <a>home subtree</a> and must
  contain at least one character. The value must not contain any <a>space characters</a>.

  <p class="note">
    There are no other restrictions on what form an ID can take; in particular, IDs can consist of
    just digits, start with a digit, start with an underscore, consist of just punctuation, etc.
  </p>

  <p class="note">
    An element's <a>unique identifier</a> can be used for a variety of purposes, most notably as a
    way to link to specific parts of a document using fragment identifiers, as a way to target an
    element when scripting, and as a way to style a specific element from CSS.
  </p>

  <div class="impl">
    Identifiers are opaque strings. Particular meanings should not be derived from the value of the
    <code>id</code> attribute.
  </div>

<h5 id="the-title-attribute">The <code>title</code> attribute</h5>

  The <dfn><code>title</code></dfn> attribute <a>represents</a> advisory information for the
  element, such as would be appropriate for a tooltip. On a link, this could be the title or a
  description of the target resource; on an image, it could be the image credit or a description of
  the image; on a paragraph, it could be a footnote or commentary on the text; on a citation, it
  could be further information about the source; on <a>interactive content</a>, it could be a label
  for, or instructions for, use of the element; and so forth. The value is text.

  <p class="note">
    Relying on the <code>title</code> attribute is currently discouraged as many user agents do not
    expose the attribute in an accessible manner as required by this specification (e.g. requiring a
    pointing device such as a mouse to cause a tooltip to appear, which excludes keyboard-only users
    and touch-only users, such as anyone with a modern phone or tablet).
  </p>

  If this attribute is omitted from an element, then it implies that the <code>title</code>
  attribute of the nearest ancestor <a>HTML element</a> with a <code>title</code> attribute set is
  also relevant to this element. Setting the attribute overrides this, explicitly stating that the
  advisory information of any ancestors is not relevant to this element. Setting the attribute to
  the empty string indicates that the element has no advisory information.

  If the <code>title</code> attribute's value contains U+000A LINE FEED (LF) characters, the content
  is split into multiple lines. Each U+000A LINE FEED (LF) character represents a line break.

  The <dfn><code>lang</code></dfn> attribute (in no namespace) specifies the primary language for
  the element's contents and for any of the element's attributes that contain text. Its value must
  be a valid BCP 47 language tag, or the empty string. Setting the attribute to the empty string
  indicates that the primary language is unknown. [[!BCP47]]

  The <dfn><code>lang</code></dfn> attribute in the <a>XML namespace</a> is defined in XML. [[!XML]]

  If these attributes are omitted from an element, then the language of this element is the same as
  the language of its parent element, if any.

  The <code>lang</code> attribute in no namespace may be used on any <a>HTML element</a>.

  The <a><code>lang</code> attribute in the <a>XML namespace</a></a> may be used on
  <a>HTML elements</a> in <a>XML documents</a>, as well as elements in other namespaces if the
  relevant specifications allow it (in particular, MathML and SVG allow <a><code>lang</code>
  attributes in the <a>XML namespace</a></a> to be specified on their elements). If both the
  <code>lang</code> attribute in no namespace and the <a><code>lang</code> attribute in the
  <a>XML namespace</a></a> are specified on the same element, they must have exactly the same value
  when compared in an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> manner.

  Authors must not use the <a><code>lang</code> attribute in the <a>XML namespace</a></a> on
  <a>HTML elements</a> in <a>HTML documents</a>. To ease migration to and from XHTML, authors may
  specify an attribute in no namespace with no prefix and with the literal localname
  "<code>xml:lang</code>" on <a>HTML elements</a> in <a>HTML documents</a>, but such attributes must
  only be specified if a <code>lang</code> attribute in no namespace is also specified, and both
  attributes must have the same value when compared in an <a>ASCII case-insensitive</a> manner.

    To determine the <dfn>language</dfn> of a node, user agents must look at the nearest ancestor
    element (including the element itself if the node is an element) that has a
    <a><code>lang</code> attribute in the <a>XML namespace</a></a> set or is an <a>HTML element</a>
    and has a <code>lang</code> in no namespace attribute set. That attribute specifies the language
    of the node (regardless of its value).

    If both the <code>lang</code> attribute in no namespace and the
    <a><code>lang</code> attribute in the <a>XML namespace</a></a> are set on an element, user
    agents must use the <a><code>lang</code> attribute in the <a>XML namespace</a></a>, and the
    <code>lang</code> attribute in no namespace must be <a>ignored</a> for the purposes of
    determining the element's language.

    If neither the node nor any of the node's ancestors, including the <a>root element</a>,
    have either attribute set, but there is a <a>pragma-set default language</a> set, then that
    is the language of the node. If there is no <a>pragma-set default language</a> set, then
    language information from a higher-level protocol (such as HTTP), if any, must be used as the
    final fallback language instead. In the absence of any such language information, and in cases
    where the higher-level protocol reports multiple languages, the language of the node is unknown,
    and the corresponding language tag is the empty string.

    If the resulting value is not a recognized language tag, then it must be treated as an unknown
    language having the given language tag, distinct from all other languages. For the purposes of
    round-tripping or communicating with other services that expect language tags, user agents
    should pass unknown language tags through unmodified, and tagged as being BCP 47 language tags,
    so that subsequent services do not interpret the data as another type of language description.
    [[!BCP47]]

    <p class="example">
      Thus, for instance, an element with <code>lang="xyzzy"</code> would be matched by the selector
      <code>:lang(xyzzy)</code> (e.g. in CSS), but it would not be matched by
      <code>:lang(abcde)</code>, even though both are equally invalid. Similarly, if a Web browser
      and screen reader working in unison communicated about the language of the element, the
      browser would tell the screen reader that the language was "xyzzy", even if it knew it was
      invalid, just in case the screen reader actually supported a language with that tag after all.
      Even if the screen reader supported both BCP 47 and another syntax for encoding language
      names, and in that other syntax the string "xyzzy" was a way to denote the Belarusian
      language, it would be <em>incorrect</em> for the screen reader to then start treating text as
      Belarusian, because "xyzzy" is not how Belarusian is described in BCP 47 codes (BCP 47 uses
      the code "be" for Belarusian).
    </p>

    If the resulting value is the empty string, then it must be interpreted as meaning that the
    language of the node is explicitly unknown.

    <hr />

    User agents may use the element's language to determine proper processing or rendering (e.g. in
    the selection of appropriate fonts or pronunciations, for dictionary selection, or for the user
    interfaces of form controls such as date pickers).

<h5 id="the-translate-attribute">The <code>translate</code> attribute</h5>

  The <dfn><code>translate</code></dfn> attribute is an <a>enumerated attribute</a> that is used to
  specify whether an element's attribute values and the values of its <code>Text</code> node
  children are to be translated when the page is localized, or whether to leave them unchanged.

  The attribute's keywords are the empty string, <code>yes</code>, and <code>no</code>. The empty
  string and the <code>yes</code> keyword map to the <i>yes</i> state. The <code>no</code> keyword
  maps to the <i>no</i> state. In addition, there is a third state, the <i>inherit</i> state, which
  is the <i>missing value default</i> (and the <i>invalid value default</i>).

  Each element (even non-HTML elements) has a <dfn>translation mode</dfn>, which is in either the
  <a>translate-enabled</a> state or the <a>no-translate</a> state. If an <a>HTML element</a>'s
  <code>translate</code> attribute is in the <i>yes</i> state, then the element's
  <a>translation mode</a> is in the <a>translate-enabled</a> state; otherwise, if the element's
  <code>translate</code> attribute is in the <i>no</i> state, then the element's
  <a>translation mode</a> is in the <a>no-translate</a> state. Otherwise, either the element's
  <code>translate</code> attribute is in the <i>inherit</i> state, or the element is not an
  <a>HTML element</a> and thus does not have a <code>translate</code> attribute; in either case, the
  element's <a>translation mode</a> is in the same state as its parent element's, if any, or in the
  <a>translate-enabled</a> state, if the element is a <a>root element</a>.

  When an element is in the <dfn>translate-enabled</dfn> state, the element's
  <a>translatable attributes</a> and the values of its <code>Text</code> node children are to be
  translated when the page is localized.

  When an element is in the <dfn>no-translate</dfn> state, the element's attribute values and the
  values of its <code>Text</code> node children are to be left as-is when the page is localized,
  e.g. because the element contains a person's name or a the name of a computer program.

  The following attributes are <dfn>translatable attributes</dfn>:

  * <code>abbr</code> on <code>th</code> elements
  * <code>alt</code> on <code>area</code>, <code>img</code>, and <code>input</code> elements
  * <code>content</code> on <code>meta</code> elements, if the <code>name</code> attribute specifies
    a metadata name whose value is known to be translatable
  * <code>download</code> on <code>a</code> and <code>area</code> elements
  * <code>label</code> on <code>menuitem</code>, <code>menu</code>, <code>optgroup</code>,
    <code>option</code>, and <code>track</code> elements
  * <code>lang</code> on <a>HTML elements</a>; must be "translated" to match the language used in
    the translation
  * <code>placeholder</code> on <code>input</code> and <code>textarea</code> elements
  * <code>srcdoc</code> on <code>iframe</code> elements; must be parsed and recursively processed
  * <code>style</code> on <a>HTML elements</a>; must be parsed and recursively processed (e.g. for
    the values of 'content' properties)
  * <code>title</code> on all <a>HTML elements</a>
  * <code>value</code> on <code>input</code> elements with a <code>type</code> attribute in the
    <a>Button</a> state or the <a>Reset Button</a> state

<h5 id="the-dir-attribute">The <dfn><code>dir</code></dfn> attribute</h5>

  : The <dfn><code>ltr</code></dfn> keyword, which maps to the <dfn>ltr</dfn> state
  :: Indicates that the contents of the element are explicitly directionally isolated left-to-right

  : The <dfn><code>rtl</code></dfn> keyword, which maps to the <dfn>rtl</dfn> state
  :: Indicates that the contents of the element are explicitly directionally isolated right-to-left

  : The <dfn><code>auto</code></dfn> keyword, which maps to the <dfn>auto</dfn> state
  :: Indicates that the contents of the element are explicitly directionally isolated text, but that
      the direction is to be determined programmatically using the contents of the element (as
      described below).

      <p class="note">
        The heuristic used by this state is very crude (it just looks at the first character with a

    As noted earlier, the <code>auto</code> value is not a panacea. The final paragraph in this

  <h5><dfn>Embedding custom non-visible data</dfn> with the <code>data-*</code> attributes</h5>

  A <dfn>custom data attribute</dfn> is an attribute in no namespace whose name starts with the
  string "<dfn><code>data-</code></dfn>", has at least one character after the
  hyphen, is <a>XML-compatible</a>, and contains no <a>uppercase ASCII letters</a>.

  <p class="note">All attribute names on <a>HTML elements</a> in <a>HTML documents</a>
  get ASCII-lowercased automatically, so the restriction on ASCII uppercase letters doesn't affect
  such documents.</p>

  <a>Custom data attributes</a> are intended to store custom
  data private to the page or application, for which there are no more appropriate attributes or
  elements.

  These attributes are not intended for use by software that is not known to the administrators
  of the site that uses the attributes. For generic extensions that are to be used by multiple
  independent tools, either this specification should be extended to provide the feature explicitly,
  or a technology like <a>microdata</a> should be used (with a standardized vocabulary).

  <div class="example">

   For instance, a site about music could annotate list items representing tracks in an album
   with custom data attributes containing the length of each track. This information could then be
   used by the site itself to allow the user to sort the list by track length, or to filter the list
   for tracks of certain lengths.

   <pre>&lt;ol>
 &lt;li>Beyond The Sea&lt;/li>
 ...
&lt;/ol></pre>

   It would be inappropriate, however, for the user to use generic software not associated with
   that music site to search for tracks of a certain length by looking at this data.

   This is because these attributes are intended for use by the site's own scripts, and are not a
   generic extension mechanism for publicly-usable metadata.

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   Similarly, a page author could write markup that provides information for a translation tool
   that they are intending to use:

   <pre>&lt;p>The third &lt;span>claim&lt;/span> covers the case of &lt;span
translate="no">HTML&lt;/span> markup.&lt;/p></pre>

   In this example, the "<code>data-mytrans-de</code>" attribute gives specific text
   for the MyTrans product to use when translating the phrase "claim" to German. However, the
   standard <code>translate</code> attribute is used to tell it that in all
   languages, "HTML" is to remain unchanged. When a standard attribute is available, there is no
   need for a <a>custom data attribute</a> to be used.

  JavaScript libraries may use the <a>custom data

  of libraries that are reused by many authors are encouraged to include their name in the attribute
  names, to reduce the risk of clashes. Where it makes sense, library authors are also encouraged to
  make the exact name used in the attribute names customizable, so that libraries whose authors
  unknowingly picked the same name can be used on the same page, and so that multiple versions of a
  particular library can be used on the same page even when those versions are not mutually
  compatible.

  <div class="example">

   For example, a library called "DoQuery" could use attribute names like <code
  >data-doquery-range</code>, and a library called "jJo" could use attributes names like
   <code>data-jjo-range</code>. The jJo library could also provide an API to set which
   prefix to use (e.g. <code>J.setDataPrefix('j2')</code>, making the attributes have names
   like <code>data-j2-range</code>).

  <a>Text content</a> in <a>HTML elements</a> with <code>Text</code> nodes in their
  <a>contents</a>, and text in attributes of <a>HTML
  elements</a> that allow free-form text, may contain characters in the ranges U+202A to U+202E
  and U+2066 to U+2069 (the bidirectional-algorithm formatting characters). However, the use of
  these characters is restricted so that any embedding or overrides generated by these characters do
  not start and end with different parent elements, and so that all such embeddings and overrides
  are explicitly terminated by a U+202C POP DIRECTIONAL FORMATTING character. This helps reduce
  incidences of text being reused in a manner that has unforeseen effects on the bidirectional
  algorithm. <a href="#refsBIDI">\[BIDI]</a>

  The aforementioned restrictions are defined by specifying that certain parts of documents form
  <a>bidirectional-algorithm formatting character ranges</a>, and then imposing a requirement
  on such ranges.

  The strings resulting from applying the following algorithm to an <a>HTML element</a> <var>element</var> are <a>bidirectional-algorithm

  <ol>

   <li>Let <var>output</var> be an empty list of strings.

   <li>Let <var>string</var> be an empty string.

   any, or null otherwise.

   <!-- while node != null do -->
   <li><i>Loop</i>: If <var>node</var> is null, jump to the step labeled
   <i>end</i>.

   <li>

    list:

    <dl class="switch">

     <dt>If <var>node</var> is a <code>Text</code> node</dt>

     <dd>Append the text data of <var>node</var> to <var>string</var>.</dd>


     <dt>If <var>node</var> is a <code>br</code> element</dt>
     <dt>If <var>node</var> is an <a>HTML element</a> that is
     <a>flow content</a> but that is not also <a>phrasing content</a></dt>

     <dd>If <var>string</var> is not the empty string, push <var>string</var>

  <p class="note">While the U+2069 POP DIRECTIONAL ISOLATE character implicitly also ends open
  embeddings and overrides, text that relies on this implicit scope closure is not conforming to
  this specification. All strings of embeddings, overrides, and isolations need to be explicitly

  <p class="note">Authors are encouraged to use the <code>dir</code> attribute, the

  Some <a>HTML elements</a> have native semantics that can be overridden. The following
  table lists these elements and their <a>default implicit ARIA semantics</a>, along with the
  restrictions that apply to those elements. Each language feature (element or attribute) in a cell
  in the first column implies, unless otherwise overridden, the ARIA semantic (role, state, or
  property) given in the cell in the second column of the same row, but this semantic may be
  overridden under the conditions listed in the cell in the third column of that row.

  The entry "<dfn>no role</dfn>", when used as a <a>strong native semantic</a>, means that no role can be used and that the
  user agent has no default mapping to ARIA roles. (However, it could have its own mappings to the
  accessibility layer.) When used as a <a>default
  implicit ARIA semantic</a>, it means the user agent has no default mapping to ARIA roles.
  (However, it could have its own mappings to the accessibility layer.)

  The WAI-ARIA specification neither requires or forbids user
  agents from enhancing native presentation and interaction behaviors
  on the basis of WAI- ARIA markup. Even mainstream user agents might
  choose to expose metadata or navigational features directly or via
  user-installed extensions; for example, exposing required form
  fields or landmark navigation. User agents are encouraged to
  maximize their usefulness to users, including users without
  disabilities.
<!--START dev-html--><!--START complete--><!-- EDITORIAL --><!--END FORK-->

  Conformance checkers are encouraged to phrase errors such that authors are encouraged to use
  more appropriate elements rather than remove accessibility annotations. For example, if an
  <code>a</code> element is marked as having the <code title="">button</code>
  role, a conformance checker could say "Use a more appropriate element to represent a button, for
  example a <code>button</code> element or an <code>input</code> element" rather than "The <code
  title="">button</code> role cannot be used with <code>a</code> elements".

  </div>

  <div class="example">

   These features can be used to make accessibility tools render content to their users in more
   useful ways. For example, ASCII art, which is really an image, appears to be text, and in the
   absence of appropriate annotations would end up being rendered by screen readers as a very
   painful reading of lots of punctuation. Using the features described in this section, one can
   instead make the ATs skip the ASCII art and just read the caption:

   <pre>&lt;figure <strong>role="img" aria-labelledby="fish-caption"</strong>> <!-- that's "l a b e l l e d" with TWO "l"s -->
 &lt;pre>
 o           .'`/

   O    .-'` ` `'-._      .')
      _/ (o)        '.  .' /
      )       )))     >&lt;  &lt;
      `\  |_\      _.'  '. \
        '-._  _ .-'       '.)
    jgs     `\__\
